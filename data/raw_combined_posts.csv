If you are, would you mind sharing your data and experiences for my blog review?

I need to confirm a finding I've made.

I've been taking Qualia Mind for a month now (Yes I am affiliated with it, but I'm not using any affiliate links here) and my deep sleep has sky rocketed!

I used to sit around 15-20% deep sleep on a 8 hour sleep (based on oura ring data).

I've just finished a bottle of qualia mind (caffeine free) and i'm averaging over 30% deep sleep. Nothing else has changed. My highest night yet was 40% deep sleep.

I've just stopped taking it a few days ago, and I'm going to see what happens with my deep sleep - it will be interesting to see if it drops off or stays up for a while.

Full review and my findings will be published in the coming weeks.

For proof of the 40% scores see the bottom of this article - [https://www.alexfergus.com/blog/how-to-increase-deep-sleep](https://www.alexfergus.com/blog/how-to-increase-deep-sleep)

They all suck.

We need an open nutrition database. The existing ones are underwhelming at best. MyFitnessPal seems to have the best one, but it's proprietary.

If technically feasible, we should scrape it. Get all the data and dump it online. From there, we can do some cleanup and merge the data with other open nutrition databases.

Once we have the data, building a better nutrition tracking app is trivial.

Personally, I just take pictures of my food. I will figure out the quantification later.

Has anyone sat and genuinely planned out how to do their data collection from first principles? This would be really cool to see.

Admittedly, much of bachelor-level statistics is about drawing conclusions about a population, and that's irrelevant when n = N = 1, i.e. you are only drawing conclusions about yourself.

But with Bayesian methods, it seems you could learn more than otherwise, by combining what's known in studies with what you discover, and it gives you the ability to update as you go, integrating knowledge from newly published studies and the data you collect. That makes the science get really up close and personal with your life.

I digress. Any links?I'm a statistician (well, applied mathematician but starting a job in data science next september so it counts hopefully?). However I still haven't had time to enter the world of QS (I'm finishing my PhD thesis). The only thing I've started is a python script to collect my mouse movements, browsing and typing patterns + questionnaire on stress, to see if there is any correlation or at least I can send myself a warning when I start to be more erratic in my behavior. I can share it when I'm done or when it's fleshed out enough!

&#x200B;

Without claiming to be an expert in QS, I'd like to share my thoughts. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I see the following issues (and propose several ideas) with statistics and QS:

* N=1, and not only that but it's impossible to blind yourself to the experiments (if any) you're doing. So placebo and nocebo effects will be very strong. 
* Even if you were able to gather data from other people, there is no control group, no randomized trials, no anything (indeed, the QS community is a self-selecting group). So causal inference and impact evaluation are \*almost\* off the table. I say almost because there is still the fact that QS users have agency to do things (like you can compare yourself taking some nootropic vs. not taking it), which according to Pearl is the only way to really evaluate causality. The only thing you need is to assume that you are in very similar conditions when you do each of your possible actions (which after all it may be less stringent an assumption than assuming everybody is independent).
* As you said, Bayesian inference (esp. Subjective Bayesianism) may be better fitted to make inferences about your data. HOWEVER, the way I see QS many people use it to make more informed choices on their life and not to *understand* themselves (in a scientific context). There you enter the realm of decision theory, so you can get away with some of the concerns about sample size: After all, you need to make a decision every day so any information is better than none (if you know how to analyze it!). I personally would like to see plausibility and possibility analysis, with well defined cost/reward functions and correcting for perception of risk/cost/reward (a la Kahneman and Tversky in prospect theory). 

&#x200B;

To sum up, in my opinion a good, useful model for QS would be a **possibility/plausibility theory** based model, more than probability, oriented towards **making decisions** and with well defined **cost/reward/utility functions,** corrected by your **prospects and perceptions**.

Each of the four blocks requires a whole theory by itself, but let me make a short explanation here:

* To build possibility/plausibility models we still need data. These are quite similar to giving confidence intervals or a bayesian probability distribution, but not the same. More importantly, these let you (imho) combine better your personal experiences with an aggregate model of the collective and weight each by its importance. For example, a project I am interested in is a way to share inference models between QS users without sharing the (possibly sensitive) data they have. This can be done for traditional probabilistic inference (it's not trivial) but I expect that with possibility theory it will be easier to share non-sensitive data (since you don't want to make a precise statement on probability, just give a ""lower bound"" of sorts). Thus with these kind of models we could eventually have easier sharing across users and build more robust predictions.
* There's a huge body of literature on decision theory. Since many of the decisions people have to make could be summarized in an A/B testing framework, I'd recommend checking out [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/b880ei/running_an_abn_test_here_is_a_tutorial_on_how_you/) to see the difference between *knowing* what is better for you and *deciding* between two options under uncertainty.
* Defining a cost/reward/utility function is a task of introspection: How much do you care about short-term rewards vs. long-term rewards? Risk vs. safety? Certainty vs. uncertainty? Once you can translate that into a function/number, you can use it in your decision function of choice.
* I am not aware of any work on trying to infer real probabilities from prospects and perceptions. I'm definitely not an expert on Kahneman and Tversky's work or anything psychological in fact. However, at least from a cursory Wikipedia read, there seems to be a large body of work there as well. If a model is built only from your personal data, you can again examine yourself and try to figure out where do you fall in terms of risk aversion and perception. If you're using aggregate data, you may need to read books on prospect theory and make a model for the average person. 

Hope some of this made sense!

I am just a lurker here, but I use a lot of statistics for the research I conduct in the social sciences. Perhaps I can help.

&#x200B;

> Has anyone sat and genuinely planned out how to do their data collection from first principles? 

I think this heavily depends on what your goal is. It seems to me that many people here just want to get to know more about themselves. Then, selectively collecting data might not be the best approach. Rather, you'd want everything you can get and then try to find patterns (see: Data Mining). If you, however, already have an expectation of what effect you'd observe and you want to check this specific expectation, planning can be valuable as it allows you to use methods of inferential statistics (e.g. the t-test). 

&#x200B;

> bachelor-level statistics is about drawing conclusions about a population, and that's irrelevant when n = N = 1 

I disagree here. Let's look at an example. Imagine you record your body temperature for two weeks. In the first week you behave completely normal, in the second week you ate something special. Let's say you find that your body temperature in the first was on average 0.5 degrees lower than in the second week. Now, is this due to some random effects or could you collect (tentative) evidence that the special food you ate affects your body temperature? Inferential statistics help you in figuring that out.

&#x200B;

Put in a more abstract way: A population does not have to describe humans, but can also describe abstract entities such as 'body temperatures at a given time'. Then, you compare the two samples from the two populations (week 1 and week 2 form a population each under your alternative hypothesis).

&#x200B;

> But with Bayesian methods, it seems you could learn more than otherwise, by combining what's known in studies with what you discover, and it gives you the ability to update as you go, integrating knowledge from newly published studies and the data you collect. That makes the science get really up close and personal with your life. 

I agree, Bayesian methods can sometimes (!) offer new ways to analyze your data. For me, the big drawback is that Bayesian statistics get \*really\* complicated really fast. I'd make sure to know the basics before jumping into Bayesian, otherwise there might be too much new stuff at once to learn.

&#x200B;

Reading the threads in this sub I often feel that most people are limited by their lack of programming skills. If you can't program, you are bound to whatever your graphical software (be it Excel or SPSS) offer to you. All the more complex or specific things are simply not possible. When you know how to program, your data truly belong to you, because only then you can truly do whatever you want. I'd always recommend learning either R or Python, depending on what you specifically want to do.

&#x200B;

If you can program, the t-test, multiple linear regressions and excessive plotting can bring you a far, far way.

If you haven't, you may find single-subject methodology of interest. Alan Kazdin's text is the definitive resource. Rather than statistical models, you are comparing behavioral performance using visual analysis of SS line graphs. I am a psych and behavior analyst and would be more than willing to talk further through DM.

[https://quantifiedself.com/blog/nick-winter-a-lazy-mans-approach-to-cognitive-testing/](https://quantifiedself.com/blog/nick-winter-a-lazy-mans-approach-to-cognitive-testing/) I liked this approach.

&#x200B;

I expect ,eventually, user gets a very long list of mostly spurious effects then tightens proof requirements for less spurious ranking. Repeat until satisfied or user's knowledge is sufficient. THEN, if QSer used common ontology, upload it for comparative analysis between others.

&#x200B;

I thin  *Algorithms* to Live By  mentions these issues.

Oh, have you seen these?

https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch

https://github.com/novoid/Memacs

I'll read about possibility theory at some point, but I'm skeptical at present. I think the whole idea of a probability distribution is to represent uncertainty via its spread -- it *should* all be there, you're even able to take into account that some data is weaker than others when you update a distribution. What do I know though ;-) 

It's my impression that a Bayesian multilevel model is often used together with a loss function that represents the cost of wrong decisions. I agree absolutely about their use and that they should be explicit (I read an argument that models that don't use a loss function still effectively have an *implicit* loss function, and that's bad because you can't criticize it).

> I am not aware of any work on trying to infer real probabilities from prospects and perceptions. I'm definitely not an expert on Kahneman and Tversky's work or anything psychological in fact.

This is gold. Nice idea.

We live in such exciting times. I feel that QS would quickly teach one about all these things without it even feeling like work.

You are right that samples can be of measurements rather than people. Silly of me!

Bigger problems are probably the lack of blinding and lack of control groups, as u/DesperateGuidance0 brought up.

Thanks for the tip!

What are SS and DM?

Thank you for your kind reply! And for those links, I didn't know them! Looks like they will save me a lot of work. 

I think that your points on Bayesian models and loss functions ( e.g. see the sleeping beauty problem, where a pretty clean answer is that the fact that she will be *right* more times if she says ""tails"" but the actual *probabilities* of heads and tails should still be 1/2, in my opinion this illustrates the difference between a loss function and a probability model very well  ) and probability vs. possibility theory are very fair, although I think possibility theory (or more in general [Dempster-Shafer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dempster%E2%80%93Shafer_theory) theory, which itself is a generalization of Subjective Bayesianism) is worth a read at least in the wikipedia entry. You can think of it as max-probability instead of additive probability, which helps with back-of-the-envelope calculations and the only thing you have to keep in mind is that Pos(not w) is not 1-Pos(w) (e.g. if you are totally uncertain of w you'd think both options are equally possible).

>We live in such exciting times. I feel that QS would quickly teach one about all these things without it even feeling like work.

 I completely agree, I don't understand why more schools don't use QS for teaching statistics; it would be so easy to make an interdisciplinary project with programming, stats, even electronics (like building an arduino electrodermal sensor) that would be super relevant to students, I'm very surprised... Or maybe very biased :P

**Dempster–Shafer theory**

The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory (DST), is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. First introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in the context of statistical inference, the theory was later developed by Glenn Shafer into a general framework for modeling epistemic uncertainty—a mathematical theory of evidence. The theory allows one to combine evidence from different sources and arrive at a degree of belief (represented by a mathematical object called belief function) that takes into account all the available evidence.

In a narrow sense, the term Dempster–Shafer theory refers to the original conception of the theory by Dempster and Shafer.

I hope this is the right sub for this question. 

I'm wondering if you know any companies, technologies or processes that might be able to help with the issue of hydration in mining environments. In the past, I have worked in the field (read: on a mine site or exploring for minerals), where it's common to work 12h shifts and you may be exposed to ambient temperatures of up to 50 °C (122°F) and it's surprisingly easy to forget to drink. On a hot day, you'd have to aim to drink between 5L and 10L, depending on your exertion level and when things get a little stressful it's easy to forget. The dangerous bit is that cognitive functions rapidly deteriorate but you aren't aware of it. 

I now work for a company bringing new technologies and solutions from other industries into the energy and resources and helping those companies get a foothold. We do this based on challenges from mining companies. I really like the most recent challenge around hydration monitoring, because I have experienced the effects myself in the past. 

Here is the full challenge statement:  [challenge link](https://unearthed.solutions/u/competitions/stay-hydrated) 

There are quite a few effects that make it challenging in a mining environment, such as long shifts, sometimes no toilet in the immediate vicinity, high temperatures, no to low internet connectivity, dust or dirt, etc. The focus is on how we can help individuals make sure they stay hydrated, not on how we monitor them. 

We are not just looking for wearables (which might be the first that comes to mind), but any type of solution that might help.

> Precision health relies on the ability to assess disease risk at an individual level, detect early preclinical conditions and initiate preventive strategies. Recent technological advances in omics and wearable monitoring enable deep molecular and physiological profiling and may provide important tools for precision health. We explored the ability of deep longitudinal profiling to make health-related discoveries, identify clinically relevant molecular pathways and affect behavior in a prospective longitudinal cohort (n = 109) enriched for risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The cohort underwent integrative personalized omics profiling from samples collected quarterly for up to 8 years (median, 2.8 years) using clinical measures and emerging technologies including genome, immunome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome and wearable monitoring. We discovered more than 67 clinically actionable health discoveries and identified multiple molecular pathways associated with metabolic, cardiovascular and oncologic pathophysiology. We developed prediction models for insulin resistance by using omics measurements, illustrating their potential to replace burdensome tests. Finally, study participation led the majority of participants to implement diet and exercise changes. Altogether, we conclude that deep longitudinal profiling can lead to actionable health discoveries and provide relevant information for precision health.

This is clearly the future. I wonder how cibsukers can gain access now, without tons of clinical oversight

From my limited research, it seems like most people create their own models or use some spreadsheets. I don't want to reinvent the wheel. I want to use well-designed industry-standard models, like [FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/FHIR/) or [OpenEHR](https://www.openehr.org/). 

I want to track everything you could think of about a person, including:

* Name
* Birth date
* Birth place
* Friends
* Family
* Immunization
* Allergies
* Prescriptions
* Medication history
* Food history
* Symptoms
* Medical procedures
* Dental health
* Blood tests
* Personal inventory
* Personality types
* Interests
* Places visited
* Events attended
* Music listened
* Movies watched
* TV shows watched
* Videos watched
* Books read
* Articles read
* Food tasted
* Comments written
* Likes
* Reviews
* Mood
* Finance
* Fitness
* IQ

I don't expect to find a single ontology/model that encompasses all of these domains, but I don't want to deal with highly specialized ontologies for each of these domains. 

How do you gather and organize all of this information into a coherent and computer-readable format?I'm interested in where the graph portion fits in - if I remember correctly, FHIR is a json-ish convention for data that describes a measurement at a given time, and can fit into any data storage mechanism, just with different ETL

I started working with ontologies in my job a little over a year ago. I wanted to make a QS ontology, but never got around to it. But I did by a domain for it :)

&#x200B;

I've been thinking about the best way to represent data collected from my QS projects. I keep switching between a simple tag-like normal relational database scheme and a full-fledged ontology with OWL and everything.

&#x200B;

The first approach will be less labor intensive to set up, and more flexible while the ontology will need a lot of initial work.

> I don't expect to find a single ontology/model that encompasses all of these domains, but I don't want to deal with highly specialized ontologies for each of these domains.  

Maybe you could glue various in depth ontologies together. This should only require dealing with the trunks?

exists a wearables and automatically measurable quantities ontology? http://devices.wolfram.com/ this exportable as OWL?

How about psychometrics and cognitive tests?

How would you track interests, given that interests vary over time? How about all kinds of unsorted observations like: ""I notice that I get in flow when the work is like so-and-so"".

It's tempting to have a list for everything, but I've tried, and for me it's hard to remember where to put everything, or even that I have a list for topic X. Given the incredibly disparate topics covered, there's also a lot of overlap between lists, which really puts a wrench in my gears: ""ugh, so into which list does this go?"". You end up with lists that can't really be trusted to be comprehensive catalogues of the thing they purport to be about, unless you can have a system where each entry can have multiple ""tags"" and so appear in multiple lists.

My goal is ""quantified world"". I want to quantify myself, as well as my environment. For that, we'll need a big ontology.

I currently keep track of myself and my environment by taking notes in text. It's not the most accurate or convenient method, but it's the most flexible one. I was thinking of deriving an ontology from my use cases, the things I track.

I think spreadsheets are flexible and intuitive. Most people use them. They're probably a good place to start. Columns should easily map to predicates. It gets complicated when you need to refer to existing rich linked resources. I think I will start with that, and convert my data to whatever ontology best maps my data.

I'm also looking at psychometric tests. I really want to make a full assessment of myself, in all ways possible (and affordable).

Those devices are interesting. I really like what Stephen Wolfram is doing. I'll try to see if I can find useful ontologies in Wolfram Language.

I often wonder if I'm getting enough macronutrients, and if they are of the right kind. I find counting the calories and protein a bit vague metrics, I would prefer something that is feedback based. Is there any cheap and preferably non-invasive way to measure blood sugar? How about protein? I was thinking about urine could be a good indicator ie: how much urea is in there.The traditional way to measure blood sugar is a fingerstick test. But the best way by far is a [CGM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor). With the former method you have to time it right, since it's not practical to stick a needle in your finger every 15 minutes for a long period of time. A CGM usually measures it automatically 4-15 times an hour and reports it to your smartphone.

Not sure what you mean by invasive. Both involve needles, but are harmless.

Edit: just saw that you wanted something cheap. I think that rules out a CGM. A regular blood sugar monitor might work though.

I would love to learn from you guys which tracking apps do you use, would you like to add some spirit of adventure to your tracking activities, and any other thoughts on the matter! Thanks for reading this!Depends on data stream

Do you have a comparison of your app’s features vs what Habitica has? It’s also not obvious from the site whether this works in browser or if an app is required.

Can you elaborate a bit? Which data streams do you have?

It does work in browser, both mobile and desktop.

&#x200B;

I don't have a comparison of features, but I did a little write-up of the key differences between the two. 

&#x200B;

Let me preface my answer with saying that I've been a power user of Habitica from its early days and thoroughly explored its API and gamification model long before starting Loresome. It remains a huge inspiration to me to this day.  Now the key differences:  

&#x200B;

1. Habitica's game mechanics are somewhat shallow if you think about it, and it gets repetitive at certain point. What is there besides 4 stats, few hundred armor/weapon reskins, pets, and 3 types of quests? Loresome on the other hand operates a full-fledged fantasy world simulation under the hood with dice rolls, vast map, hundreds of monsters, and nearly endless potential for hero activities and quests. Every feature is designed to be scalable and interoperable with the rest of the game mechanics. My main intention is to use it myself, and gamification only works when it has surprises. So my goal is to build a world that will surprise me every so often :) 

2. To complement the previous point, Habitica hasn't received a major feature update in >3 years. I was waiting for new features at first, but they seem to be happy with just releasing a paid background pack every month. 

3. There's no easy way of integrating anything 3P with Habitica. I tried synchronizing todo lists, fitness trackers, arduino-based hardware devices, and it had been painful and didn't really work that well. Loresome is designed from the ground up to work with anything that has an API 

4. Managing the avatar in Habitica takes a lot of time. Choosing the right armor, hatching the eggs, spending your daily mana, allocating skill points, drinking potions... For a productivity app it consumes tremendous amounts of user time and provides opportunities for procrastination. In Loresome the hero manages everything, the user can just follow their progress (and provide the sweet rewards!). It's an explicit goal in the design to make it exciting to come back, but boring to stay for more than few minutes. 

&#x200B;

 All that being said, I still think Habitica is a great product that has shown the world (and me) that B2C gamification is a viable thing. And I'm looking forward to a healthy competition :)

Why are you using such an odd rating scale? Seems to go against psychometric research...

Can you share more on how the ""Personal Data Science"" features are meant to work? This is one area where existing mood-tracking apps come up a bit short. Consider drinking alcohol in the evening: This may make your day better, but your next day a lot worse. Or going to bed late, which may have no effect, unless done several times in a row. Then there is the problem of how to communicate confidence in a relationship, or even helping people establish causality...

Will it be opensource?

Mind expanding? I am not sure what you mean by 'odd rating scale' nor am i up on psychometric research ;)

TLDR: Because it works better for everyone who tested the app until now.

We have experimented with a lot of different options. 1/3/5 worked well with our beta testers, better than any other options. We have indeed gone thru psychometric research, and even so, decided to go with 1/3/5.  I would change the scale in a heartbeat if we found something better.

Very strange! I just tested it and it worked. Would you be ok with me contacting you in private to test this out?

>I am not sure what you mean by 'odd rating scale'

Did you look at the website? The scale OP is proposing is very unusual. This is presented as a benefit when really, it's a big flaw.

>nor am i up on psychometric research

Right, well... it's a field of research on how to measure psychological constructs. In short, the scale proposed for this app is terrible and goes against findings in psychometric research.

I just think that if OP plans on designing a psychometric scale, they might find some time to, you know, research the thing they're trying to develop instead of making something that can be expected to be crap based on prior published findings. That's all.

>We have indeed gone thru psychometric research

Cool, then you'll find it easy to cite the papers you referenced that made you conclude that this is a good scale.  
[I'll wait.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/waiting-for-op)

>TLDR: Because it works better for everyone who tested the app until now.  

Great, so you can share some de-identified aggregate statistics that support this, given how surprising it is given your scale flies in the face of what's been published.

I did look at the website and thought that a 1/3/5 scale sounds interesting since I cannot differentiate between 2 and 3 anyways. Didn't realise that is a big no-no.

Reached out in private. Would love to know more your experience in this field.

Yeah, ""sounds interesting"" is probably a fine way to sell an app. ""Actually works"" is another issue, because this scale would produce data of poor quality compared to other scales that could have been used.

This is seriously amazing! I love that you took your data and dove into insights. What are you going to do with those 500,000 data points???

I'm gearing up to start my own tracking journey - the general goals of finding what makes me most productive, happy, healthy, etc... any insights you wish you had in the beginning?

Also, one thing I didn't see...how do you feel now compared to when you first started?

I’m here for this thread! I’m as interested in your data analytics as the insights you’re finding. I’ve been collecting every data point I can for 12 years (the types and volume of data increasing as sensors and APIs have increased)... I’m mostly just storing it now and awaiting some holy grail of machine learning or something. Although, I quite like Exist.io as the best aggregator out there now. ... but my favorite part of QS is the quick blink insights (love that term, BTW). I have that same finding about two days of poor sleep. For me, two days of back to back meetings has a similar effect. I’ve also been really curious about salt and hydration lately....there are times when I wake up and feel disgusting and I can’t figure out why. I’m vegan, but not always a healthy vegan -I love some of the salty fake meat stuff -and I really resonate with the ‘hang over’ feeling of having had too much processed stuff. 

Can’t wait to hear what else you find. Thanks for sharing!

I write down everything I eat (and recently started taking pictures) but I don't think I would be able to quantify (or even approximate) my intake on a day-to-day basis. It's not only time consuming, but the context switching breaks the flow. I can imagine that if you're preparing your own food, eat once a day, or eat the same thing regularly, it might be easier to track than in my case (traveling and eating out every day).

Can you share a bit more about your food logging strategy?

The point regarding salt and sugar is particularly surprising and useful, thanks.

I really like Gyroscope and I find the trends more useful than the ones Merlin Mann mentions that he gets from Exist.io on his podcasts.

I know Exist.io has been around for longer but I started with Gyroscope and I'm hesitant to make the switch now. I also really like Gyroscope's stance on privacy..

Which do to use and why?I can’t remember where but I found [this article](https://www.thevectorimpact.com/how-to-change-your-life/) a few months ago and I think it does a great job of outlining both options. Personally I’m all in on Gyroscope.

I use both. They're both pretty much zero effort apps, so there's no harm in running both.

I find Exist easier to quickly understand and interpret, and much simpler to navigate. But Gyroscope is much prettier, and covers a lot more detail, but is also much harder to navigate, and is more difficult to interpret, given that it tends to focus on attractive graphs and visualisations rather than simplified insights like in Exist. 

Even though they're both kind of doing the same thing, they're very different apps and services. So to me it makes sense to have both, because one can't really replace the other.

Gyroscope is hands-down the best vanity dashboard :-)

This is perfect if your main reason for tracking is for motivation.

Zenobase is my fave. More you did not know about ; https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self#aggregators--dashboards

Do any of these apps output a csv file for further analysis?

That's what I was thinking of! I didn't save it and Google couldn't find it. Thank you!

I can only afford one though. Gyroscope has been having some weird bugs lately but the devs are on top of it...I think if I added *another* app that uses my location in the background my phone would be dead pretty quickly. 

Do you find the insights Exist provides are good? With Merlin Mann it's turned into a running bit on his podcasts.

I use it to track trends because I have like 30 medical conditions and I got sick of reenacting the Louis CK incurable shitty ankle bit every time I went to the doctor.

I'm a non-developer so exporting info can be tough for me with some of these apps. I just found Zenobase from a different thread though and they let you pretty easily export your data as a CSV!

I'm pretty sure Exist.io does.

There shouldn’t be any extra battery drain. I run Arc, Exist, and Gyroscope on my main phone, and none of them cause battery problems. 

Arc you sure you can’t afford both? They’re very cheap. 

As to Exist’s insights, so far I’m enjoying them, but I’ve been using it for less than a month, so I’m still getting familiar with it.

Gyroscope isn't an app that comes to mind when I think of a general-purpose (or symptom-) tracking app, though if it captures everything (or even most of what) you happen to need, that's great!

Why Arc? Gyroscope does the same thing. There's definitely been battery drain on my phone since i've started using Gyroscope. The battery screen of my iPhone's settings shows that it's even higher than Overcast and I listen to podcasts nearly 24/7. 

I'm on very limited income but I'll see what I can do next month. When I upgrade my iPhone in June it'll be an even tighter budgetr because I need the fancy iPhone due to my disability (eye tracking, etc).

Arc is my app. I made it. It’s the most accurate and detailed timeline recording app available, and there’s really not anything in the same class as it. 

If you want accurate, detailed timeline data, Arc is the only option. Gyroscope’s Places feature is low detail and low accuracy. Gyroscope’s benefits are in its other features, not in its timeline recording. 

Gyroscope also uses more battery than Arc, for lesser quality recordings. So if saving battery is important to you, and accurate and detailed timelines are important to you, then Arc is the best choice. 

I use Gyroscope for all its other features. I also do daily comparisons between Gyroscope’s and Arc’s timeline recordings, to ensure that Arc is still the best.

Ah! Sorry, I didn't recognize the user name.

I've downloaded it and turned off Places in Gyroscope. Do you have the location tracking enabled it Exist? I downloaded it to see how it is.

> Do you have the location tracking enabled it Exist?

Yeah, but it seems like they haven't put much focus on that functionality yet. So I'm not really expecting Exist to do much with location / timeline stuff yet. 

I rely on Arc for all my timeline/location/places/travel data and analysis. Then Gyroscope for health/productivity/mood. And now I'm finding ways to get value out of Exist, which has overlap with Gyroscope, but presents easier to understand insights.

Exist isn't going into as much detail as Gyroscope, but I appreciate it for the insights that it extracts from the data, which I wouldn't otherwise be aware of in Gyroscope, like the correlations between different factors and patterns in my life.

True. It's only the weather, which is fine I think.

I started using Exist as well last night and I can see what you mean.  I like Gyroscope for a bird's eye view, Exist.io for the correlations and slightly more detailed view, Arc for location tracking, and if I need to dig deep into the data I can open AutoSleep, HeartWatch, etc.

By the way, is Gyroscope the top most in settings > batter for you? Just out of curiosity. It says it's been running in the background over the last 10 days for 128h 2m!

> By the way, is Gyroscope the top most in settings > batter for you? Just out of curiosity. It says it's been running in the background over the last 10 days for 128h 2m!

On my test devices, where I do daily comparisons between Arc and Gyroscope (and some others), Gyroscope is usually the top of the list, because those phones literally only run Arc and Gyroscope and other competitor apps. And Gyroscope is usually only marginally higher than Arc, and still running near peak efficiency, so usually it's not something to worry about. 

It's normal for it to say that it's been running in the background constantly, because that's what's necessary for recording location data constantly throughout the day (ie for Gyroscope's Places feature). 

Arc will typically show that it's spent less time running in the background, and use less battery even though it gets higher accuracy and detail. But Arc will still show up as having spent many hours alive in the background, because that's necessary for all day location recording. 

Unless Gyroscope is using more battery than things like Reddit or Twitter or Mail or Safari or things like that, I wouldn't worry about it. But if it *is* using more battery than apps that you use often in the foreground, then that would mean something is going wrong.

Gyroscope is number one usually (ie) using the most battery nearly all the time. Which is why I'm concerned. I've disabled Places and switched to Arc. Maybe that'll fix it?

Sounds like something’s going wrong with your Gyroscope. I’d contact their support about it. It’s usually less efficient than Arc, but only marginally so. If it’s always the heaviest battery user, then something’s going wrong.

I'll see how it dates this week. I just turned off Places yesterday so the battery usage isn't accurate.

FWIW when I did mention it they said it was normal.

Arc is such a great app by the way!

If you're still worried about horizontal placement use a level, start by checking your tiles, maybe your bathroom floor isn't horizontal in the first place.

Kind of offtopic, but my scale was not quite accurate while it was in my bathroom. I think it was too humid there.

As soon as I moved it to my bedroom, things were great!

Edit: The scale could not read my body fat properly. The weight was fine.

I placed it in my bathroom so I would weigh myself each morning and night while brushing my teeth. It was pretty effective.

However, water got into the scale and it stopped working, so you should be careful of that

Thanks!I like the combination of rescuetime (logs sites/apps I use and I label whether they are productive or not), lifecycle (logs where I’ve been and what I am doing there, and I can have labels of whether that event is productive or not), and a habit tracker or todo list like Coach.me (I identify a few things that I want to get done that day, and then see how many I actually get done).

It’s a super tricky metric though, I really wish there comes a time where it becomes easier & more personal to measure.

Time use tracker like rescue-time or activitywatch for time spent on project. Quantified mind and human benchmark for how smart? I am in this 8 hour period. Mysymptoms to log how focused I am on the work. I research and program computers so the work is not easily quantifiable. Maybe spell checking and debugging could be measured somehow.

I take pictures of:

* myself
* food I eat
* pills I consume
* items I purchase
* restaurant menus
* receipts I get
* content of the toilet
* places I visit
* my weight on a scale

It seems like the majority of the things I track can be seen, hence the camera can be used to capture those sights. A video or audio recording could take care of everything that can be heard. For things that can't be seen or heard (internal feelings, ideas, memories), they could be narrated or typed as a note (saved as text or with screenshot). If I had a 24/7 wearable camera, I probably wouldn't have to track anything manually, other than occasionally uttering how I feel out loud.

Could this be the holy grail? Do we really need a bunch of use-case specific apps? What do you manually track that couldn't be accurately captured using a camera?Since most sensory input we receive is visual, I agree that a camera can be helpful, but the issue is with data compilation. For example, if you wanted to plot your weight change, a very simple task if you had manually recorded the weight as a number, you would have to first filter through all your images for ones with a scale then extract the number as a digit to plot over time. That kind of computer vision is becoming easier for the average person to do, but it still isn't trivial. If an app provided it, I would be worried about privacy and cost since so many images from my daily life are being used. 

&#x200B;

If you want to do something more complicated like understand how the pills you take and the food you're eating impact your weight, the problem becomes much more difficult. You have to match parts of images of food to their nutritional content and identify which pills you consumed, a much harder task that simply pulling a number from an image since there's such a variety of food and different preparations of the same food item may have very different nutritional value that isn't noticeable by eye. For example, how much butter you used in your mashed potatoes might not be noticeable in a camera after it's stirred in. (A video camera might catch it, but you just massively increased the volume of data then.) If instead you had tracked the food manually with associated nutritional information, you could much more easily analyze.

&#x200B;

I think you're on the right track, but maybe a few decades ahead of technology. 

&#x200B;

As for your final question, I track my mood and my internal dialog. This would be hard to get from a camera. Further, **I find the actual act of tracking helpful.** I notice when something has triggered a bad mood and can intervene right then. 

&#x200B;

When do you review what your camera has captured?

Any kind of machine analysis will require numbers and that means writing it down or very very advanced machine learning for image classification. I have read an app can classify food based on user's pictures.

Currently, I eat out for 100% of my meals. Unless I eat at a fast food restaurant, I don't know the nutritional profile of my food. The best I can do is estimate the nutrients based on what I see. A picture captures pretty much all of that. Whether I, some nutrition expert, the restaurant's cook, or some machine learning algorithm, calculates the nutrients based on the picture can be decided afterwards. Given a scale and a detailed recipe, this probably could be achieved quite accurately.

What if a visual tool designed to estimate portion sizes/volumes/quantities, ingredients, density, cooking method, similar looking past entries (e.g., from same person or restaurant), recipe finding, from a set of pictures existed? Something an expert could use to approximately quantify the nutritional profile of a picture of food? I've seen cooks on TV accurately replicate a recipe just by looking at it, so surely something can be done?

I'm actually looking to invest time and money into building something like this (whether for food, feces, skin conditions, receipts), but I need to know if people would be satisfied with level of friction (take a picture) and the level of accuracy (80%?). I feel like 80% of accuracy for 20% of the effort should be sufficient, but I don't know if other people would agree.

I think there are a ton of opportunities (and low hanging fruits) when it comes to converting the physical world into digital models (not just quantified self, but quantified environment).

That's still an open question. 

Up until recently, I've also been writing down what I took pictures of. This makes it easier to extract information and metrics. Now, I'm just taking pictures.

Maybe I will have to go through every picture daily/weekly/monthly to annotate them. Maybe I can automate some of that using machine learning. Maybe I can delegate some of it to mechanical turks.

In addition the nutrition data and sleep seems to be inaccurate. I asked the developer and they gave me the usual boilerplate stuff. 

Does anyone know why this is? I use AutoSleep, MyFitnessPal, HeartWatch, Water Minder, Daylio (does not write to Apple Health), Scelta (deeper dive than Gyroscope to weight and it has more numbers) and wear an Apple Watch.

I'm also interested in any new apps that may track something I'm not tracking. I'm looking into getting a WiFi scale to track things automatically but none of the Wirecutter's picks are compatible with Gyroscope.I'm the developer of Gyroscope's competitor, [Arc App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arc-app-location-activity/id1063151918?mt=8), and will defend Gyroscope on several points here. (I also use Gyroscope daily, because it has gone in a slightly different direction than my app, and has some features I like, that my app doesn't have). 

While Gyroscope's battery drain is marginally worse than Arc's, it is only marginally so, and Gyroscope tends to run at near peak efficiency most of the time. The Places feature requires that Gyroscope be alive and recording 24 hours a day, which is a very difficult thing to do efficiently and consistently (iOS makes it very difficult to do so). There are unavoidable battery costs in providing a feature like that. 

> I notice my iPhone is running hot occasionally since I started using this app.

Your phone running hot may not be related to Gyroscope. There are a lot of system services that can cause the phone to run hot at different times of the day, so it's not always possible to identify which app or service is causing the phone to run hot. In my experience with my own app, when the phone is running hot it's almost never due to my app, but instead something else. I suspect the same will be true of Gyroscope.

> In addition the nutrition data and sleep seems to be inaccurate. I asked the developer and they gave me the usual boilerplate stuff.

For sleep recording, I believe Gyroscope only provides rudimentary built in sleep recording, for people who don't want to use dedicated sleep recording apps. If you are already using AutoSleep, then that should be saving its data to Apple Health, and Gyroscope reading that information and using that instead of its own basic sleep recording algorithm. Make sure that that is the case. 

Personally I use Pillow on my Apple Watch, and then visualise that data in Gyroscope and Arc. 

For nutrition data, I couldn't say, because I don't personally keep a record of my own eating habits. 

> I'm looking into getting a WiFi scale to track things automatically but none of the Wirecutter's picks are compatible with Gyroscope.

I use Withings scales, which save their data to Apple Health, which Gyroscope can then read just fine (weight and body fat percentage). No problems there.

Honestly, if you're looking for an app like Gyroscope, there's nothing better out there. My own app is focused specifically on daily timeline recording (ie places and trips), so it thoroughly beats Gyroscope on that in terms of detail and accuracy and efficiency, but for all of the other features that Gyroscope offers that Arc doesn't, you're not going to find anything better than Gyroscope.

The market for these kinds of apps is littered with incomplete and unreliable and abandoned attempts. It is a much more complex type of app to build than most other kinds, so many people attempt it and fail. There's really only two apps left in the game: Gyroscope and Arc, and I use both. 

I've been using Gyroscope for a few years and haven't had any issues with the service itself. I've only had issues with other apps or services not working correctly, which causes Gyroscope to have incorrect data. I used to use AutoSleep and Pillow for sleep but after using Gyroscope's built in Sleep AI, I've found it to be more accurate over time. 

I will say that the developers are generally responsive and if an issue is with their app, and not your phone or other apps, they will tell you. Since there are a lot of variables at play, I wouldn't say the problem is necessarily with Gyroscope. 

As for a WiFi scale, any that write to Apple Health will be compatible with Gyroscope because that's where it gets your data. I picked up a cheap one and it works great.

It also drains battery. Gyroscope isn't worth until they get their shit together. 

I didn't mean to imply it was a bad app; I was just have problems that I and the devs couldn't figure out.

I understand about the battery, that's fine.

The only thing that's changed is that I've started using Gyroscope though. I haven't done anything new other than that.

AutoSleep was working correctly. The issue was Clock was also writing data; I've since disabled that.

I think it has something to do with the way MyFitnessPal writes data too Apple Health and when I delete something it doesn't delete the entry or when I exercise it changes the calorie displayed in MFP but not Health. I use it because I'm trying to get certain nutrients for medical reasons. 

I assume a slight difference won't have an effect on the trends in Gyroscope even though the real calories are in MFP?

I can't travel much so Gyroscope is more to my liking. It doesn't do deep diving into the data (like HeartWatch, AutoSleep MFP or Scelta do). I don't think it was designed to, right? It's more for the big picture and trends?

Gyroscope giving me the big picture and HeartWatch, AutoSleep, MFP, Scelta and Daylio give me more of a deep dive into the numbers so I use all of them.

Do you like the scale? I was looking at it but the Wirecutter says the app has been updated to not be useful. Also the privacy policy: good?

I think the issue is with MFP. It has so many bugs in the app itself but unfortunately it has the best database.

Why both Pillow and AutoSleep?

The battery drain is unavoidable, unfortunately. The Places feature requires that the app be alive 24 hours a day, recording (or ready to record) location data. There's no way to do that without battery drain. 

While my own app does that task more energy efficiently, the difference in battery consumption between the two apps is marginal. It's an energy cost that simply can't be avoided, if you want that kind of feature. 

I really like the Withings scale. Their app works fine for me, and I can visualise the data in Apple Health too.  

The doubling up of Apple Health data is one reason why I’m very wary of apps that automatically write data to Apple Health. They tend to make a mess, and most of them have that bug where if you delete the entry in their app, it doesn’t get deleted in Apple Health, so mess gets left behind. MFP sounds like it has that problem.

Basically you end up having to do cleanup in Apple Health yourself, because apps that write to it won’t clean up after themselves. I recommend checking in Apple Health and doing cleanup in there, for any stray or incorrect data that various apps are leaving behind. Gyroscope won’t be able to tell which is the data you do and don’t want, so it’ll just read it all. 

I’ve got that problem with Pillow at the moment, where it’s writing every sleep record to Apple Health twice. Sigh. 



I used Pillow until I discovered AutoSleep. Pillow writes a bit crappier data into Apple Health than AutoSleep so I switched. Not sure if that's still the case. AutoSleep was great but I kept having to adjust the times because it would catch movement from my partner or my dog or cat and assume I was awake. The only thing I don't like about Gyroscope's SleepAI is that it doesn't record in Apple Health but I'm ok with it.

Thanks for your reply but I know for a fact that it doesn't need to drain battery. In fact it could use 0% energy drain with the functionality to locate places just using iOS own inbuilt ""common places"" system. 

There are other smarter apps that have correctly utilized this.

How accurate is it? I really like the idea of automatically logging weight and and stuff.

The issue I have lately is the data in Apple Health is different than the data in Gyroscope. I double checked. It isn't the apps that are writing to it.

Your facts are wrong. 

I’m sorry, but you are talking to one of the main experts in this field (me). When I say what the situation is with location data recording, I am saying it with expert authority. Your information is wrong.

> How accurate is it? I really like the idea of automatically logging weight and and stuff.

The Withings? They're very accurate for weight. But for things like body fat percentage, they're only accurate within their own measurements. Meaning that the difference between today's measurement and yesterday's measurement is accurate, but the actual number it creates isn't necessarily close to the actual real number. 

So they're good for accurately monitoring trends in changes over time, but don't necessarily give you the most accurate numbers in isolation (except for weight, which is very accurate, down to 100 grams or better). 

But that problem is true of *all* body fat scales. The technology used by body fat scales simply can't do better than they're doing now. The only way to get more accurate numbers is to use more complex and time consuming measurement techniques. (I think something to do with immersing yourself in water, or some such. Which ... I don't think any of us can be bothered to do every morning). 

> The issue I have lately is the data in Apple Health is different than the data in Gyroscope.

Which data? Gyroscope will be sourcing most of its data directly from Apple Health, but not all things. So you'll need to pinpoint which specific data, to debug the problem.

Maybe you aren't that much of an authority then. I am using such a service daily and know that it works. Maybe you could tone down on your self boosting and I could make you wiser.

Do you have this one? Withings / Nokia | Body - Smart Weight & BMI Wi-Fi Digital Scale with smartphone app, Black https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0728K4371/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_kNoRCbM0WH54Y

The Wirecutter says the app is bad now but if I don't use that as my dashboard and instead use Apple Health or Gyroscope I don't see a problem.


I had a DXA recently but I can find body fat percentage on the report.

The nutrition data. It's definitely an issue with Gyroscope and not MyFitnessPal because when the data in Apple Health is correct (no duplicates, etc) it's off by about 1,000 calories. It only happens every once in a while.

You are not using such a service. No such service exists. 

There is: CLVisit monitoring, Significant Location Change monitoring, deferred location updates, CLRegion monitoring. 

None of these use zero battery, and none of them are accurate enough to produce worthwhile results. CLVisit, CLRegion, and SLC monitoring use the least energy, and all are incapable of achieving accuracy better than a 100 metres, with most results being off by several hundreds of metres and several minutes. They cannot be used to achieve something like Gyroscope’s timelines or Arc’s timelines. 

They can be used to achieve something like Google Timeline’s timelines. But anyone who has used that knows it’s not in anyway comparable to Arc or Gyroscope. It is utter rubbish in comparison. 

Maybe you should stop talking about topics that you know nothing about. Especially so when you’re speaking with experts in the field. 

Seriously.

I've got the [Body Cardio](https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-cardio). 

> The Wirecutter says the app is bad now but if I don't use that as my dashboard and instead use Apple Health or Gyroscope I don't see a problem.

I totally disagree with Wirecutter there. The app is really quite good! It even has [a score of 4.5 on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/withings-health-mate/id542701020?mt=8), which is very good. (My own app hovers between 4.5 and 4.6, and Gyroscope currently has 4.5 also).

Is there any reason to get the Cardio instead of the Body+ if you have an Apple Watch? The cardio is more expensive and the only difference is it takes your heart rate (which my Apple Watch already does).

I'd probably just use the app to feed data into Apple Health and do a deep dive into the data with Scelta and Gyroscope (Scelta gives you the ability to see more deep data than Gyroscope while Gyroscope only does trends; I do the same for heart rate (HeartWatch) , sleep (AutoSleep) and mood (Daylio).

> Is there any reason to get the Cardio instead of the Body+ if you have an Apple Watch? 

I can't see any point in the Cardio. I even turned off the heart rate reading on mine, because it's less accurate than my Apple Watch's reading. 

I really only got the Cardio because that's what was available in the shop I bought it from. I don't make use of any of the extra features it has. All I want is weight and body composition (fat, water, bone), and I'm pretty sure the Body+ does all that.

So a Withings scale is worth the investment?

I don’t see any accurate gadgets out there. Any suggestions?I came across the iButton while researching for a self-experimentation project (I wanted to see if going on a week long rafting trip would have an effect on my circadian rhythm, and body temperature is supposedly a good proxy). Later, I made friends with a couple circadian rhythm researchers and it turns out that they use the same device. Using athletic tape, attach one to the inside of your wrist for distal temperature and another to the area below your arm pit for proximal temperature. Despite the Apple-sounding name, these are industrial devices, so they are incredibly sturdy (one use case is putting them in a packing crate of fresh fish to make sure the temperature didn't reach a certain threshold during transit). 

They have some inconveniences though. Their onboard memory lasts for about a week before it starts writing over itself (though you can make it last longer by having the measurement intervals be less frequent). The battery only lasts about a year and is not replaceable. 

You will have to purchase a reader that transfers the data to a computer (be sure to mark your devices clearly so that you know which is proximal and which is distal; it's easy to get confused once they are off your body). The companion software ([OneWireViewer](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/interface/one-wire/software-tools.html)) is clunky and will take some effort to figure out. 

Another thing to know is which side of the button to press against your skin. One side of the button has a slight flange that flares out at the bottom. However, the sensing is on the top side. So, you will want the ""top"" to be pressed against your skin. 

Total cost for two iButtons and a reader is about $100, but could be as low as $36 if you don't need a high resolution (explanation below).

* Here's some [general info](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton/ibuttons/index.cfm) about the iButton.
* Here's a [validation study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938406001818) for the use of the iButton for measuring skin temperature accurately.
* There are a lot of [different versions](https://para.maximintegrated.com/search.mvp?fam=data-loggers&808=iButton&1028=Temperature) of the iButton. My friends use the [DS1922L](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton/data-loggers/DS1922L.html)($87). It has a high resolution (.0625 centigrade) and wide temperature range. The budget option would be the [DS1921](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/datasheet/index.mvp/id/3246/part/DS1921H)($39). The resoution is .125 centigrade and the temperature range is still within normal body temperatures (up to 114 Fahrenheit). The [DS1920](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton/ibutton/DS1920.html) is a lot cheaper ($9), but the resolution is only .5 Centigrade . Maybe that's okay for your use case.
* Regarding [readers](https://para.maximintegrated.com/en/results.mvp?fam=ibuttonr_a), I have a [DS1402-RP8](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton/ibutton/DS1402-RP8.html) with a [DS9490R adapter](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton/ibutton/DS9490.html) ($26, to see a picture, click on the ""data sheet""). Weirdly, their readers don't plug directly into usb; you have to use an adapter. The one exception and the one I recommend is the [DS9490B](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton/ibutton/DS9490B.html)($20).

I hope this helps. It was all pretty confusing for me to figure this out on my own, so hopefully this saves you some time.

Gyroscope's Places made me carry my laptop for a week while I was on a vacation abroad, just to have _some_ battery on my phone.

Nice maps tho. 

Arc killed my battery, and the develop got a little testy when I continued to provide feedback without paying for the app first.

I'll look into Quantified Map and LifeCycle, but it sounds like Gyroscope will give me the same issues.

Life Cycle works well for me, and ymmv, but it has had the least impact on battery of everything I’ve tried. 

I do wonder if OP has GPS constantly on tho. When I have GPS on - I use Fog of World - my battery drains as described (iPhone 7). 

Google Location History works great, though they occasionally recompute/clobber your old data, and make you export your data one day at a time...

&#x200B;

Thanks.  Google Maps on my iPhone, anyway, doesn't reliably track me, doesn't follow my REAL route (unless I log on, daily, to the web version and ""pin"" my location to roads, and does nothing with steps (not really a requirement).  The accuracy is the kicker for me, on this one.  Some days, it just doesn't track me at all.

Yeah I think LC has the least impact on battery life too.

I didn't know about fog of world - what a fun app! Going to try it out, thanks.

Fog of World is fun! It’s also useful when I’m in new areas and am trying to get my bearings - I can see where I’ve been and where I need to go without relying on nav. 

Does drain my battery in four hours or so tho.

not sure if this is the right place to post, but I am currently looking for a way to track my sleep and improve it. At the moment I'm thinking about buying a cheap mi band. How could I possibly use this data?
Thank you in advance! 😊I'm using an Apple Watch with the Autosleep app. Works fantastically well, without any effort. The app also does a decent job of creating actionable analysis.

No consumer device without EEG is going to score above 70% in stage agreement compared to PSG. If you’re just looking for total sleep time, sure, but don’t pay any attention to stage separation, because all the wrist wearables still blow at that, and I don’t know if they ever won’t.

The next era in sleep tracking is wireless EEG.

Obviously Fitbit with sleep tracking (blaze) 

Then

I use my Fitbit -> exist (the life tracking software)

And

Fitbit -> ifttt-> iOS health app -> iOS clock (bedtime)

And

Fitbit -> ifttt -> iOS reminders to sleep earlier if inadequate sleep

And Fitbit -> beeminder for incentives to sleep earlier 

I'm going to start doing the same with my Fitbit Charge 3. I'm not sure how accurate it really is. But my plan is to start tracking other things along side with it, like diet and coffee consumption, exercise, weather, etc.  


From this I want to learn how the various sleep stages are affected. I'm especially interested in deep sleep. Supposedly deep sleep decreases with age, and by the time you're 80 it basically vanishes. So I'm thinking if you can figure out how to maximize it, it might prove useful for longevity.

From what I read the bands monitor start and end of sleep very well, steps ok and deep sleep poorly. Getting the data out of the Mi Band may be hard. I started trying to do this via gogleheath but never really finished it. Far more advanced methods exist for sure but can you manage them?

Yeah guess I'll keep looking. There's just so many of them and most don't do what I want. Some are trying to be 'automatic' and others are trying to 'give insights'. I literally just want to track my time and have categories.

Temperature, heart beat, steps, movement, blood oxidation. Look up glucose testers on this sub. I have read of subcutaneous biomarker testers in futurology.

Sounds like we’re getting there in terms of physical/outward measurements. Will check out that sub!

Ketones, maybe?

Continous PPG, ECG and glucose monitoring already are pretty established, I believe tracking hormones such as already mentioned cortisol or more generally things like neuroinflammation or apoptosis biomarkers would be incredibly interesting.

Ah, yeah sorry about that. We actually have a fix for it, but it requires the raw SQLite datastore which isn't the default yet.

Noted, I've posted about the project in the past and got a decent response so figured there were people here who'd appreciate an update. If I'd want to make the post seem less low effort, how could I improve? (the post itself took a while to write, but I can see how it might still seem low-effort).

I am! I wrote the update :)

>It's an automated screen time tracker. What makes it better than the alternatives?

There is a feature comparison of popular alternatives in the README: https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/

>Is it secure?

It's secure if your computer is secure but we haven't done a thorough audit nor implemented more advanced security features yet (like password-protection of old data).

No, it's definitely of value. But a single phrase mentioning that it was a community project or how it's of use to subbers would be nice for those of us encountering it for the first time.

Since you have a Polar H10 in addition to the Apple Watch, I'm guessing you concluded that the Apple Watch isn't accurate enough for running?

I found chest straps (incl ""smart shirts"") to be too much trouble, so I'm now using an optical arm strap instead (a Scosche Rhythm24, similar devices include the Polar OH1 and the Wahoo TICKR FIT).

Have used all the apps mentioned above, but surprisingly none of them seem to support simply recording heart rate against time (without also tracking distance or location). Found an Android app, [myWorkouts](https://www.myworkouts.org/), that does just that; not sure about iOS.

apple health, zenobase exist.io

Have that one too. 

How do you mean that Gyroscope helps me here?

I have that one too. But not really relevant to what I want to achieve here. 

Thanks! No I got the Polar just because it's the gear that is recommended for most accurate HRV reading by the leading apps. That's why. But sure, it is a hassle to put on every morning just to get the HRV. But what to do. 

Now I wanted to use it for more than HRV, hence my post. 

based on your setup, gyroscope will give you the most bang for your buck

[deleted]

FWIW the latest generation optical heart rate monitors appear to be good enough for accurate HRV readings, as long as you don't move and stay out of bright light... See my notes at [https://forum.quantifiedself.com/t/tracking-recovery-from-aerobic-exercise/6517](https://forum.quantifiedself.com/t/tracking-recovery-from-aerobic-exercise/6517).

Totally agree. And thanks for the suggestions about Fitiv. 

However, this post was about measuring ***running, gym,*** and health. Sorry if I didn't made that clear enough.

Trust your judgement, and write it down?

You would need an intellect greater than your own. See Halting problem. I stick with time working multiplied by mean of several cognitive tests like https://www.humanbenchmark.com. EDIT: or hindsight rather than intellect.

[deleted]

The key to data collection is to collect as much as is feasible, and then perform data analysis later.

You \*should\* track word count, time spent writing.  You should probably also track where you are writing (what chapter?), as well as some sort of daily review of how effective that day's writing was.  The point of this phase is to collect as much data as is reasonable without being overbearing.

(As a side note, some data is really tough to collect.  Logging the number of words read sounds difficult to me.  Maybe there are E-readers that give you that data.  Sometimes you have to accept that some data isn't worth the effort to collect)

&#x200B;

Then, later on, you do data analysis.  This is where you try to figure out what data is irrelevant, and what data isn't.  A huge part of quantified self is to find correlations that you didn't expect.  (If you knew the correlations beforehand, then there's no point to collecting data).

&#x200B;

My rule of thumb is:  If it is easy/automatic to collect, then I'll collect it.  Otherwise, I need to really consider how important that raw data is to me.

[deleted]

[deleted]

[deleted]

At the end of every hour (or other unit) of work, take a moment to review whether what you just did was ""time used well"" or ""pointless busy work"". Maybe even assign a score and write it down.

This process can be valuable on its own, but if you do collect enough data, it could be interesting to see if there are any clear trends, or correlations with factors such sleep or exercise...

I am working on those questions right now. A bunch of different ones put together can be used to estimate the magnificent G intelligence quotient. You can do prepared batteries on quantified mind. I think they include almost all tests available for free to the public.

There's no hard-and-fast rule to apply to determine if it is worth it.  Some things are obvious:  if you are concerned about health, tracking food & exercise is worth the effort, even if that effort is high.  But if it isn't obvious, and it requires a non-trivial amount of effort?  I'd probably say ""no"", but it's really up to you to consider if that data has potential.

&#x200B;

(I've never thought about data collection as a sculpture, but your summary is accurate).

[deleted]

Any favorite ways of doing this on your phone?Nomie, but alas it is discontinuing.

I use mySymptoms. its symptoms tracking is fantastic. It is also diy flexible so for every activity I just include it in ""exercises"". For notes I write them in np++ and parse with R.

I've been using Daylio for roughly this.

  
It lets you define a list of activities and icons, so it's really easy to say ""Today I had X mood, and did all of these activities"".  I'm currently at 28 activities, and they all fit on a single screen.

You can also add custom notes below, that I've been using if I want to be more specific.  (For example, if I played a board game, I'll list all of the board games below).

Daylio is centered around mood, so if you don't want to track your mood, then that's an additional button press you'd have to do every entry.  


For other numerical data, (such as food consumption/exercise/sleeping), I use other apps that are designed for this, and then I have a script that combines all of the data from the different apps. 

I prefer a different apps for different kinds of data because it minimizes the effort it takes to enter in data.  For example, it's far easier to use a timer (so you just press a single button to start and a single button to stop) to track sleep, than trying to type that stuff in.  


I'm building something big in this sphere :D Its coming!

Hi - I'm a developer and co-founder of WeAchieve - [www.weachieve.io](https://www.weachieve.io)! We should be able to handle anything you throw at us and are on iOS + full web platform.

&#x200B;

We're still pretty early on and don't have an export option, but happy to handle one-off requests until that is built :-)

&#x200B;

Best,  
Ben

Depends on what you want to collect

(On Android) I've using [Trackendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sickmartian.calendartracker) and I recently discovered [KeepTrack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zagalaga.keeptrack). They let you define the type of the variable (numerical, categorical, etc.) and export your data.

Oh no! What do you think people will move to?

I'm an R fan but I haven't heard of np++ (not a real coder)!

That is an admirable system but way too complicated for me! I already use myfitnesspal and garmin connect. I decided to just set up a Google spreadsheet for the other stuff.

Thanks for the Daylio recommendation. I'm trying it out for the next couple of weeks. I didn't get into it the first time. Do you have a specific place/way that you aggregate your data after? Something like zenobase or just raw csvs?

That's awesome! My ideal data entry app would display a form that refreshes daily and has an easy way to log whether an activity occurred, followed by entering both the timestamp and duration (when relevant). The times would have to be editable since I often forget to log things exactly when they happen, or don't have my phone. But I would like the time right now to show up as the default answer. (Of course it would need to export as well.) Is that the sort of thing your app can do?

It doesn't really. I want a flexible system where I can define the variables, vector type, and factor levels. After seeing the discouraging initial responses here I just set up a Google spreadsheet on my phone. 🤷‍♀️

Still looking for something that was as flexible (and secure). Seriously considering hiring a dev to write me a prototype with a similar feature set, but with extensibility for the gamification I've been doing on my own data.

notepad ++
its just better notepad. with a few additional modules I made it timestamp whenever I pressed ctrl-shft-a.

I wrote a Python script to import into a database.  I'd be willing to share that, but I'm not sure how useful it'd be if you don't know programming, as there are definitely parts of my code that are intended for a database, which then I plan on using R (another programming language) to find correlations.

&#x200B;

If you are interested in using my script, I can definitely explain it and show you around. 

&#x200B;

If all of that sounds too complicated, Zenobase sounds like a good idea, but even something like excel can work great.

Our data entry isn't quite like that, but you can set up any number of custom 'activities' with various field types. So you could have a 'morning routine' activity that has a bunch of metrics you'd track - these can be yes/no, text, number, clock time and time durations. So on the input side it should be able to handle everything I think :-)

On the output, we don't yet have the export option, but that is planned within the next month or so, at least from the web.

Let me know if you have any other questions! Would love your thoughts if you give it a try :-)

Lol 

Hello I'm your dev.

But seriously, I've been searching for the holy grail since forever, and still haven't found it.

I'm currently using a very simple app I built. It works on any platform (web, Android, iOS), works offline, and syncs automatically with all devices. It's basically like a one-way chat app, where I send things like:

* good morning
* anxious about tomorrow's presentation
* 10 push-ups
* shower
* \[picture of breakfast\]
* \[selfie\]
* bought water bottle for $2.00 from vending machine
* \[picture of water bottle's barcode\]
* drank 10 sips water
* pee
* \[million dollar idea\]
* headache
* 200mg advil
* watched Bird Box
* \[picture of barcode of snack I will eat\]
* brush teeth
* good night

I initially wanted to build a chat bot, but most platforms didn't work well offline.

The app is set as my Android launcher, so that I can access it in the press of a button (home). If I want to launch an app that's not already in my history/multi-tasking, I type ""launcher"" and it launches an actual launcher. This added friction makes me less likely to mindlessly launch distracting apps. To take pictures (which is my favorite way to input things), I just double-press the power button. I'm looking to add NFC support, to automatically log things by tapping my phone on NFC tags (e.g., night stand, toilet flush, car, tv remote, water bottle, gym equipment, toothbrush, pill bottle, wallet, fridge, etc).

My next step will be to use NLP to extract meaning from these text entries and image recognition to extract meaning from pictures. I weekly manual review should take care of the edge cases.

I'm pretty decent with R, but my Python skills are still pretty limited to my fields of specialization. So yeah, I'd love to take a look at your script!

There are a couple of potential problems I see with this method, I'd be interested in your responses:

1. Typing.  I hate typing:  it's slow and prone to errors.  I don't want to type in ""good morning"" every morning, I'd rather just press an ""Awake"" button (or have my phone detect it automatically).  Or, instead of typing everything that I bought (with the annoying press-hold to get the dollar sign), press a purchase button and type in fields.

2. Time.  If I am late to say ""good morning"" am I allowed to go back and edit my time?  Describing it as a chat bot makes me think ""no"", but not allowing modifying the message time seems like a huge dealbreaker to many.

3. Other input sources.  Lets say I want to track websites I visit.  Obviously, your phone can't track what I'm doing on my computer, but other software can (like RescueTime).

&#x200B;

Do you have plans to address these?  


Finally, as a final thought: it's easy to want the world for an app, but actually making an app that covers all possible data collection is time consuming. How much time do you plan on sinking into this?

Ok, here you go:  [https://github.com/nathanmerrill/trackmyself](https://github.com/nathanmerrill/trackmyself) Run [report.py](https://reports.py) to run the script.

Some caveats:

1. This is still in active development.  My latest daylio code wasn't up to speed, so I had to update it before posting it here.  That said, I just tested daylio, and it's importing now.
2. You don't have a file called [apiKeys.py](https://apiKeys.py).  This file contains all of the api keys I've obtained for all of the different services.  For the purposes of daylio, it also contains the name of the csv file.
3. There are lots of hardcoded values.  For example, I have hard-coded in the moods.  I also expect that the Note field contains a list of ""ActivityName: activity description"".

&#x200B;

TLDR: unless you are doing exactly the same system as I, things won't work when you first run it.  Hopefully it should help you get started though :)

1. I'm the biggest natural language hater. Typing sucks. But text is flexible, universally supported, and easy to implement. The list of possible actions like ""Awake"" for which you might want a dedicated button can grow very quickly. Typing let me quickly experiment with the breadth and depth of what I want to track. The pain of typing is a reminder that this is not the final solution.

2. I often forget to log things as they happen. I'll often add ""10 minutes ago"" or ""before brushing teeth"", ""yesterday 10PM"" to late entries. I plan to improve that by visualizing my log on a timeline and/or by adding some kind of time-travel knob.

3. The goal is to manually track only what can't yet be automatically tracked. I don't manually track computer usage, browser history, credit card transactions, steps, GPS location, etc. I manually track cash transactions, food intake, mood, etc. I want to get more wearable/IoT devices to automate more of the tracking (e.g., sleep, weight). I want scheduled events/tasks to be automatically tracked (e.g., take 1 pill every day at 8AM). I want to reduce input friction by taking pictures (e.g., snack's barcode, meal, receipt) and tapping NFC tags (e.g., toilet, medication, water dispenser). Typing should be used as a last resort, and auto-suggestion should suggest the most context-relevant/frequently-used keywords/tags.

I currently don't have any responsibility or commitment other than breathing, drinking, eating and sleeping. I have a ton of free time. I expect this to continue for the next 6 months. 

Aaaamazing! Thanks so much. I also use RescueTime. Should be able to fiddle enough to get this working from here :)

So, if I understand correctly, you are planning on this tool being used as a data collection tool (with processing to assist data collection).  The idea here is that other tools will take this data, combine it with other data sources, and then do analysis?

&#x200B;

Also, I hadn't thought about ""10 minutes ago"" in the chat log.  I think that's rather clever.

Yes. The plan is to have a handful of low-friction tools that can be used to collect/log as much information as possible.

I'm currently using my phone's GPS, camera, NFC sensor, text input app to achieve most of this.

The opposite side of the coin is the universal inbox. I'm redirecting all notifications/messages/reminders/alerts/tasks/links/rss/subscriptions to my email. Instead of manually visiting a bunch of different websites every day, or regularly searching for some keywords/filters every week, I automate it so that it comes to me in the form of digests.

Thank you for this work. It will help me immensely in my own project.

> For low reaction time (<300ms for simple reaction time <600ms for visual matching), the plots don’t look continuous, there are some sudden drops. That’s pretty suspicious IMO.

Maybe it punishes subjects who prioritize speed over accuracy too much.

> If you think about, 8 (out of 16) errors is what you would get on visual matching if you answer randomly (which you could do with almost arbitrary low reaction time). So if you do that, say, with 400ms delay, according to the plot you would score around 620 points. Which is what I get by doing the test myself with 800ms reaction and making 1 error. So what does the score represent then?

Ouch this is bad. I get about 700 on VM though. No wrong again. barely 620. I must apologize for saying 500 is median of population and 800 is top 95%.

Determining latent factors would probably be much easier with all data separate instead of rolled into one score.

You can export your data from LibreView, or also via Tidepool (if you are using the reader device).

There's a mobile app in the Australian app store (LibreLink) that syncs directly via NFC, but doesn't work with my HK sensors (they've blocked this).

LibreView to Tidepool uploader via desktop and USB gets it into a usable graphical webview.

But Tidepool iOS doesn't push to healthkit (yet). So it's relatively static still... Any tips on getting it into healthkit? Ideally without a weekly manual upload?

isn't an iphone7+ sufficient for this?

I use a traveler’s notebook, not an app. 

Thank you for the kind words!

I discovered that my partner has a lot more impact on my mood than I thought. The three lowest points are fights with him. The highest points are good times with him or good news at work :-) 

I'd say I'm at ~6 average. On a 1-5 scale, 3. So what caused the downturn right after the 13th?

Haven’t heard of that, what is it?

Please excuse my compulsive coaching but:

Have you thought of how to facilitate good moods that are not contingent upon external circumstances or people?

Happiness happens to us. Contentment is created.

I struggle with bipolar disorder. It's hard to see with only two months of data but my mood is cyclical. My mood started going down, and was worsened by a fight with my partner.

Its just a paper journalling method :-)

My mood is mostly contingent on a healthy lifestyle. So I sleep well, go to the gym regularly, and eat healthy. Do you have other suggestions?

Very interesting. I'd like to see a detailed report where you track all of your daily activities for 3 months and see what the correlations are between your moods

Would be hard to say without a lengthy conversation. But sounds like you're on the right track with investigation. Good luck!

I’ll have that data in a month :-)

I dont have a medical background but would like to learn how to administer IV syringes on myself (for vitamins, NAD) as well as PRP/BPC 157 injections directly into muscle. What is the best way to learn how to do that cheaply and safely without going to months and months of a formal schooling or degree?

&#x200B;

Thank you. This sounds like a very very bad idea. You should talk to a medical professional. 

If you haven't learned for it don't even try...

I do not know whether it is a terrible idea to inject yourself with this stuff. IT REALLY MIGHT BE.  (I suggest googling terms like “danger intravenous injection”). But I can partially answer your question:

Injecting into a muscle is pretty easy and apparently doesn’t take much training at all to do safely.  Women undergoing fertility treatment are routinely taught to give themselves IM injections of ovary-stimulating drugs, and the instructions for doing it are basically wash your hands well first, wipe the area to be injected with alcohol, and make sure the syringe doesn’t brush against any nonsterile surface before it goes into you.  

For IV injections, there are training videos online for medical professionals.  You can study them.  The big danger I’m aware of is injecting air accidentally   (Because blood in the vein clots around the bubble and then the clot can cause damage). There may be other big dangers too.  Jesus, man, read up on it. 

its a worry that this may be for drugs other than vitamins/NAD.

please get these done at approved facilities (if needed).

no medical 'professional' will train you for this.

Or marry one...

Thank you, muscle injections are easy.

For IV's - I am not afraid of blood so that is not an issue, but you're right things can go wrong. I will look to see if I can find a way to get trained by professionals. Definitely do not want blood clots.

I am curious if anybody knows (maybe based on past Samsung products) how the upcoming galaxy fit watches might record and export data (https://www.tomsguide.com/us/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-hands-on,news-29465.html).

I am quite into yoga and meditation, but am also very keen on improving my analysis and visualisation skills in R. The possibility of observing minute by minute changes in heart rate and other metrics during my hours of physical, breathing, and meditation practices contrasted with eating and working times gets me a little excited, but I have no idea if this is possible.

Could any body enlighten me on the likelihood of me being able to do this for every block of 60 seconds / 10 minutes / 30 minutes? Am I thinking of the data structure in the wrong way altogether? 

Do these recently-released wearables have export functionality built in, or do they need to be hacked?

Thanks for considering my questions and apologies if the answers were easy to find elsewhere (I must be a bad searcher in that case). There is a [Samsung Health SDK](https://developer.samsung.com/health) which allows third-party apps like [FitnessSyncer](https://www.fitnesssyncer.com/support/samsung-health) to export data, assuming you're unable to get the data you want directly.

you mean you want to be able to zoom into that level of detail or see it as it happens? If its the first it can be done in R.

I want to be able to export data after a day or a week and examine historical data at the [minute] level from that period.

I want better data than that:  I want to know the time of day that I ate something (so I can correlate it with my location and other activities).  


The only other requirement I really have is the ability to scan foods in (which most popular food tracking apps can do).I think myfitnesspal has that ability but I think it’s a paid feature. 

You may want to give Bitesnap a try, which does a pretty good job time tracking with photos.

mySymptoms is my favorite and timestamps for free but i do not know about scanning

cronometer paid version also has a time stamp feature, but the free version allows you to write notes which I use to record my timestamps manually

It appears you are right.  Unfortunately, I don't think I want to pay $10 a month for timestamps.

I actually had downloaded this one, but didn't end up trusting the image recognition of food.  Have you used it?  Is it pretty good at recognizing what I'm eating?

It does!  Unfortunately, the few items I tried weren't recognized, so I'm not sure how large their database.  I'll keep playing with it.

Yeah, paid feature. I have it - $50/year. I got it because of a few other premium features and mostly ignore the time food is eaten... Too much to pay attention to...

Maybe you can use them for macros or something that integrates with IFTTT and export to a spreadsheet or something?

It works surprisingly well for me, and it’s very easy to select appropriate foods. I currently use Cronometer because that app has much more detailed micronutrient tracking, but Bitesnap’s UI is far superior.

If you’ve downloaded the app why don’t you just try it out to see if you like it or not?

I've been trying to think how this would work.  I could start myfitnesspal using Automate or something and send off an API request at the same time, but (1) I don't know how to correlate the time with the food item in myfitnesspal, and (2) I'd have to scan exactly 1 item every time I start the app or manually fix the data.

I actually downloaded 15 apps before making this post, so I didn't really give a lot of them a full try (due to large amount of time that would have taken).  


I actually discovered that they also have barcode scanning, but I haven't been able to actually work on any barcodes.  Anyways, TLDR: I'm giving this one a bigger shot.  I'll see how it goes.

I made one spreadsheet that converts broad goals into trackable data and then helps you track them: [\[picture\]](https://i.imgur.com/NaEe0Gr.png)

I'm also working on a spreadsheet that allows you to create a custom designed habit tracker with no spreadsheet experience.

&#x200B;

But I feel like these are both pieces of a greater whole. Eventually I'd like to make the ultimate ""Quantified Self"" tracking spreadsheet. Something that is easy to navigate and has everything you need!

1. Yes/No Habit tracking
2. Mood tracking
3. Statistical feedback
4. Graphs
5. etc.

Thanks!

&#x200B;An open source platform with modular, self configurable database and components to bring data in, and visualize in multiple ways - all with locally stored data and on a locally hosted machine would be ideal.  

For now, I have been tracking annual lab results and my physical measurements (weight,...) manually in a spreadsheet with graphs, shown here.  Works well for now, but something like Home Assistant will be very nice. [https://imgur.com/i1k77Jg](https://imgur.com/i1k77Jg)

Go learn python try [exist.io](https://exist.io) or zenobase. Add to www.[openhumans.org](https://openhumans.org) .

Smart predictions.

I suggest making a modular system of spreadsheets—each one (different tabs?) tracking some specific aspect of one's life, and informing other sheets where the data might be relevant. This would allow users to choose which sheets to activate, and what data show up in their main/""ultimate"" sheet. I'd honestly be happy to collaborate/brainstorm together, because I too believe that until [Exist.io](https://Exist.io) and [gyrosco.pe](https://gyrosco.pe) and such apps (which I'm trying this month) become more robust it's worthwhile to at least aggregate data which can be put in CSV form and easily imported to other apps/analysed using Excel/Tableau/etc. Good luck!

 I used to like spreadsheets too. Its what gave me the boost to learn R. As a method of input spreadsheets may be good. But spreadsheets can not compete with R and python. Many of the features you already listed can not be accomplished in them. Tidyverse is easy to start with.

Basically a statistics tool software

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)

Ah very interesting. This is extremely helpful, very clean graphs. Would you mind screen shotting how you enter the data as well? Blur out the values if you want, but it would be helpful to see how you have organized your inputs

I've been thinking of starting an open source self hosted version of one of these, similar to the way home assistant is for home automation. All self hosted so you don't have to worry about your data getting leaked. Super configurable and able to use any kind of data or analysis... Have you heard of anything like this?

Serious, question, are there any opensource equivalents to exist.io?  The idea of putting my very personal bio-data into proprietary systems is a bit too off putting for me. 

>exist.io

yeah damn [exist.io](https://exist.io) seems like the perfect solution that already exists. as in, there's no need for any other productivity software ever. what are some of its downsides? I guess the only one I think think of without trying it is that it costs?

What do you mean by that? 

Oh yes that's a great idea. I'd even like to incorporate r, so that you hit a button and it runs the data through r and spits the information back out in excel.

So the first tab would need to be like a settings page where you pick what parts you want to incorporate. And then maybe a main calendar tab where you enter all the information based on the settings you chose. And then statistical feedback tabs for each of those parts.

So the first question is, what parts should there be? Simple yes/no habit tracking, numerical values habit tracking, mood tracking, etc.. I'll have to check out exist etc. to see what they are like

Agreed. That's why I'm thinking of integrating the two. Aka input data into spreadsheet --> automatically runs it through R --> spits it back out it spreadsheet.

It would just require that people download R along with the spreadsheet but it should work

your data never leaves your computer

**R (programming language)**

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, data mining surveys, and studies of scholarly literature databases show substantial increases in popularity in recent years. as of  February 2019, R ranks 15th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.A GNU package, source code for the R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran and R itself, and is freely available under the GNU General Public License.

can you elaborate on this? why should I be worried using their software?

it just does correlation by day which is really simplistic for time series comparison



To me, a big downside is availability of APIs.  This isn't [exist.io](https://exist.io)'s fault, but it is a technical limitation that any webservice would have.  


As a more concrete example, I want to track my location.  I always have my phone's location on, and Google is really good at guessing where I've been.  However, there's no public API for location history:  It's only something you can manually download.

Analysis will require either the goal of prediction or expertise in analysis to decide how to proceed at difficult steps.

What is R?


You need to look at mySymptoms on the smart phones. But maybe as output or configuration UI?



Never heard of these? 

It's *highly* valuable data and you have no idea what will be done with it. Sure, they can tell you about how they care about privacy (yada yada yada). With an opensource solution, the code can be audited and run on my own server.

2 things:

1. The issue with all these trackers is that years ago humans didnt need all these trackers and life went on. Apple and other companies created the need to track to sell us stuff.

2. A lot of apps posted in the article require work to input. If an app is too complicated and has too many steps it's a no-no.

You're giving Apple too much credit: They were rather late to jump on the self-tracking bandwagon...

There are quite a few things I want to track, such as:

1. Sleep
2. Heart rate
3. Steps/activity (these 3 can be done with my Fitbit, of course.)
4. My mood at various times, not just once a day.
5. My internet/computer usage.
6. How many pages I've read a day.

Among a lot of other things. I'd like to ask your opinion on how much I should track just starting out, whether a combination of apps or just one app would be the best to use, or maybe I start with spreadsheet or paper tracking?

Thanks in advance, and sorry if y'all get this question all the time.1. Track everything that can be automatically tracked.
2. Manually track a single thing for 30 days before adding a new one.
3. Don't bother with analysis before you have 3-6 months of data.

Hey u/carrendelle, I'm also pretty new to this, and everyone is going to be different in terms of what they track and how they do so, but here are some things that have worked well for me so far:

Firstly, sit down and really try to understand why you want to track each of the items you've listed. For me, sleep was a huge pain point because I kept waking up feeling tired and sluggish, and it was taking a lot to get me moving each morning. Basically it was killing productivity in the mornings, which meant less hours in the day as I was trying to make up unproductive work hours in my personal time. I also wanted to track pages/chapters read as a sign of productivity, but ended up not doing so because it wasn't something that had a consistent metric to it (some pages have more/less words on them, or I may 'read' twice as many pages but not absorb any of it). I ended up opting to track time spent reading instead.

Look at each key metric and try to identify how one device can automatically record as much as possible. For me, I've been able to tick most of the boxes with my iPhone & the Apple Health app, Oura ring and an app called [gyrosco.pe](https://gyrosco.pe). I also like to track caffeine intake, which I do manually. Like u/miguelos said, tracking everything that can be automatically tracked is awesome mainly for the convenience factor, but if your device(s) can do it, allow them to track EVERYTHING even if you don't think it's particularly of interest. Worst case, you don't use the data, best case you may be happy you did later.

I'd also suggest reading everything you can find to get different perspectives - I found this article pretty helpful when I first started and pointed me towards a few apps that I'm now using. [http://www.markwk.com/tracking-tools.html](http://www.markwk.com/tracking-tools.html)

Good luck!  


Edit: fixed link

Why? What's your goal? Pick outcomes that will allow you to detect that.

Whichever tracking method is the easiest to be consistent is the best one for you. 

Explore your data regularly so that you can test intuitions, and revise your sampling mehtods.

I have been using Daylio for tracking mood/activities and journaling every day for the last two years and it's been life-changing for me. It also allows for multiple moods/entries per day. 

As for internet time, I use a Chrome extension called Web Timer.

Thank you, all of this makes perfect sense. I don't want to try to track everything at once and end up overwhelming myself.

It's not a bad idea to try to analyze your data even before you have enough data, as you don't want to spend months collecting data only to realize that you forgot to capture a crucial variable or that there are other issues with the data... Also, depending on what you're interested in, several months may either be overkill or not enough! And if you want to find causal relationships, you probably need to think about experiment design (e.g. A/B testing).

do you mean [https://gyrosco.pe/](https://gyrosco.pe/) ?

How do feel about daylios statistical feedback though?

I found it to be very lackluster. The only useful statistic was looking back on the entries themselves via the pixel grid thing. 

Have you thought about this, and would you like something that gives more useful and meaningful feedback? 

Haha yep, spelling mistake!

I guess the statistical feedback for mood could be better but I've been using Daylio for so long that I would have a hard time switching to another app, even if it were better. Its calendar screen is decent for visualizing mood data, I'd say. I track a lot of things in Daylio like meditation, yoga, socializing, health issues, tiredness and so on, those are useful for reviewing and comparing my months. But as I said earlier on this sub, I actually like its simplicity (even though it means that you don't get super detailed data) because if it were more complicated, I probably wouldn't have used it every day for the last 2-3 years. The emotional release I get when I write down something that bothers me is more valuable to me than a bunch of useful data visualizations.

TL;DR It would be great if someone made an app as simple as Daylio that also allowed for more complex data analysis but if that's not possible I'd rather have an app that's super simple and enjoyable to use than one that gives more detailed analysis.

I ran one of the basic Fitbit ones against Samsung Gear Fit2.

That Gear is so damn accurate.

It mapped sleep / awake cycles well clear impacts from needing to go to the toilet (lighter sleep before, and no sleep while walking and then a while to get back to sleep also).

One correlation that is interesting is the accuracy of reported satisfaction vs. Objective sleep metrics that the device records eg 8hours effective sleep reported vs feeling 5/5 energy.

The key part of circadian driven wakeup times makes a huge impact to  morning awakeness. Eg if I wake up at the peak of my circadian rhythm I am good to go and feel fantastic. 

If I have a long duration of sleep eg 7 hours vs 2 effective hours I feel way better, especially if lots of deep Delta sleep cycles eg 4 hours with say 3 cycles vs 7 hours but erratic bedtime over the last week means the first deep wave takes ages to kick in and may have only 3 or 4 cycles in the 7 hours time, for about the same subjective quality of sleep. 

Regular, healthy non disrupted sleep, results in deeper and better quality sometimes with less time sleeping. 

I have read people often making jokes about random iWatch notifications that are really inaccurate or incorrect (No Im not swimming, I am at the pub drinking!). I haven't used one, but the Samsung is a beast.

Hi ran88dom99, I agree with you that being able to export data is super critical for consumer apps. Especially the raw data, rather than summarized daily aggregated data.

When talking about deep sleep, I think there are two approaches. One is actually looking at brain waves which is what a polysomnography does, but not something you can do at home. Another is just guessing based on wake up times, which seems disingenuous to me since it's not actually using sensor data to infer sleep stage. There's not a good way to actually figure out sleep stage from a wearable or app, because your body doesn't change much in terms of behavior, besides a bit of eye flicker and brain waves changing.

Hi guys.

I got approval to post this from one of the mods earlier and I hope to meet open ears with you as well.

More than 6 years ago (I was 18 to that time) I developed my first Android app which happened to be a blood alcohol calculator, partly because to that time I personally had the need for a proper app for that matter, LOL (I'm a German, you know...).

AlcDroid has been more or less popular in Germany, occasionally getting name-dropped in some German articles from newspaper media or whatever, especially recently when it came to New Year's Eve and everybody drank a bit more than usual. And even though Germany is not the only place where there's party at New Year's Eve and stuff, it is less popular in other parts of the world.

I just recently started to enhance AlcDroid to become more and more an overall alcohol consumption tracker rather than just a BAC estimator that you use once in a while at some party. I would love to hear what the more English-speaking community has to say about this (and I figured I might find some experts here, right?). This may sound a bit naive, since an alcohol testing app might be considered as rather simple and universal, but there are some things I did not always think too much about in practice, like units (fluid ounces and stuff), and while I have implemented those features in theory, I am not too confident about how they turn out in ""real life"".

More info: [http://alcdroid.flx-apps.com](https://alcdroid.flx-apps.com/en)Is there any way to export the drinking data into a CSV, or some other spreadsheet type format?

[removed]

[removed]

I wish you could have a version on F-Droid (not sure they would allow the app though as it serves ads). 

Your website needs a proper certificate BTW... 

what do you think about wearables? [www.ionwearable.com](https://www.ionwearable.com)  
potential for collaboration?

Right now, the drinks are stored in a sqlite database (as it is common practice on Android). That's also the file format of the backup, when you create one. I might add a csv backup function, too, if there are more people asking for that (I'll add it to my backlog for sure). Until then you could use e.g. tools like this to obtain csv files of drinking data and presets from the database: https://www.rebasedata.com/conversion/b8ec51586b84d048ca26a22619d98998. 

The statistics, however, are calculated on the fly and not stored in a database. 

Downloads != installs. Installs are around only 3000, so I have a pretty small retention rate.. which is rather usual I guess? But my app used to be worse, as I said, it has been online for like soon to be seven years, so that might play into those numbers, too.

I do make money off of this, but mainly from the paid pro version, as the ad income is like just a few bucks per month right now. It used to be significantly more like a year ago: I had the app offline for like 6 months because of all this GDPR hassle in Europe for which I unfortunately had no time to take care of. That was a mistake because it feels like I have to start all over again in terms of popularity and downloads. I hope I'll get there again. 

I genuinely believe that my app is the best Alcohol Tracking app on Google Play right now. There's always been ""AlcoDroid"" (the almost-identity of the names are a coincidence, really, I didn't know that app back when I was 18, I don't even know who has been around longer), which was always nice in terms of functionality, but its interface got long in the tooth and I think I qualitatively passed the app at some point. I wished that would be reflected in the ratings as well... it is really difficult to still get a good rating, if you got a couple of 1 star ratings like 5 years ago. 

Anyway, thanks for the kind words! 

Thanks for trying it out! :D If you have any thoughts about it, let me know.

All in the form of numbers on a scale from for example 1-5.

I found a free statistics application which seems pretty decent (it's called Past3). It allows me to easily copy over all my data points, and has a TON of different options for doing statistical analyses etc. So far the most useful thing I've found is just the simple Graph Plot, but I'd like to figure out how to get more useful visualizations of my data. I have very little knowledge of statistics.

For example, how could I take my sleep quality, and see how each other variable affected it? If you're familiar with sleep cycle and how they show data correlation, that's exactly what I mean.

There are so many options to choose from in the application: univariate, multivariate, model, diversity, timeseries, stratigraphy etc, each with a dropdown menu of so many options.  I barely learned any statistics in school so any tips would be greatly appreciated.

If anyone could point me to a guide of sorts that would be awesomeIt really depends on how you want to approach it.

&#x200B;

If the objective is to understand how a set of variables that change (independent variables) affect another variable that changes (dependent variable) then you may want to do a simple multivariate regression.

&#x200B;

In the case of your sleep quality, you have created a scalar variable that is a number between 0 and X that represents the quality of sleep you received in a given time frame. So you might set that variable equal to a function of the collection of other variables.

&#x200B;

I would probably start by installing R and then Rstudio a powerful and free statistical analysis suite.

Then finally following the steps in this guide on how to perform correlation and regression tests in R[http://www.cookbook-r.com/Statistical\_analysis/Regression\_and\_correlation/](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Statistical_analysis/Regression_and_correlation/)

&#x200B;

R has plenty of data visualization packages as well that can help you explore your data.

Yeah, step-wise GLM would probably be the most meaningful way to see what influences any given dependent (outcome) variable. R stats is great (get ggplot for visualization), but [Plot.ly](https://Plot.ly) is also really nice (especially if you know python).

GLMs are just fancy multi-variate regressions that can handle wonky data. Stepwise means that there are cutoff criteria for adding variables to minimize over-fitting your model.

At the level of the individual, and as someone without a background in experimental design, anything that looks statistically significant probably isn't. However, recognize that anecdotal and suggestive results can still be useful to you if they help you refine and test hypotheses. You will not be able to ""prove"" anything, but you can still use it to improve.

Have fun ;)

I would say you should do some data exploration on your own. You can start by graphing each variable vs each other variable on an x-y plot in what's called a scatterplot matrix. Look at each of these plots and see if any of them exhibit any kind of behavior that looks like correlation. If it does, you could add it as a factor to a linear model ""sleep quality"" = b0 + b1*""x"" and kind of quantify how much increasing ""x"" would help you increase ""sleep quality"".

The previous poster mentioned R which is a good choice, I use it all the time. If you just wanted to look at graphs only you could use Excel. The benefit of doing this analysis in R is that it will tell you if the variable has a statistically significant p-value (is there a relationship between x and sleep quality or is it just random noise) and will tell you the correlation, or R^2 value. Hope that helps.

This guy Mark Koester has [a fantastic Github Repo with Python Notebooks](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger) explaining through example (a guide) how to export your data from many popular services, visualize it, and graph it for correlations. R is a great tool, but I usually do this in Python because I'm more  comfortable there. 

[This app from researchers at Brown](https://medium.com/@brown.university.hci/sleepcoacher-how-to-complete-your-2019-resolution-to-sleep-better-one-self-experiment-at-a-time-a6237ce2ec3c) ([mentioned on the r/quantifiedself sub previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/amv8sm/wearing_and_comparing_10_sleep_trackers/)) has a collection of experiments (with good experimental methodology) that you could try yourself to improve/optimize your sleep.

Finally, my friend and I wrote a Data Driven Year in Review post where we analyzed patterns in our sleep vs productivity data. That post could lend you some inspiration for finding patterns and correlations. https://mementolabs.io/blog/year-in-review-2018

Good luck happy tracking!

Do you have a link to where you downloaded the program? 

Learning R takes time. Try datacamp.

You could bin your data by day. So one row is one day and in it you write how much sleep you got the night before or after in one column and productivity in the second etc.  Otherwise I have not found a formal method for causation over time analysis. Time series is all about seasonal - cyclical - autocorrelation and that just involves time and one variable. Maybe send your data to zenobase datasense openhumans exist.io


Thank you! 

Would you by any chance know what this kind of data representation is called? [https://gregblome.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sc4-2.png](https://gregblome.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sc4-2.png)

The step-wise GLM sounds highly useful for all sorts of QS analysis where we're often looking for how many variables (like sleep, exercise, steps, caffiene) effect one outcome (productivity or distracted time online). Have you (or anyone) used GLMs for this type of analysis before? Are there other types of multivariate regressions you would suggest? I've been diving into my own data in Pandas and finding some great patterns, but I'd love to step up my game (and even move to R, which I'm pretty rusty in, if necessary haha). Thanks for any advice!

Thanks!

I got it from:
http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/

If R is more complicated than Past then I'm not sure I'll utilize it. I can't be bothered to put too much effort into analysing my data as I don't think there is much to deduct from it currently. Mostly interested right now because I've ordered an Oura ring, and it unfortunately does not have a feature such as sleep cycle to show how different things affect your sleep.

That's exactly how my data looks in my spreadsheet, each row equals one day, with the variables in different columns.

I mean, it's a bar chart. But the % contribution is probably just a visualization of the weight of each of the factors on the regression.

If you wanted to run statistical analysis on this you would use an ANOVA. This can be done in R.

GLMs are great, and very robust. The limitation is not the quality of the statistics, it's the quality of the data and the experimental design. Garbage in, garbage out really applies here. I'm really curious to see the types of challenges that come up with the way people are recording data, but I've got too many irons in the fire to do such a collaboration for free. There was someone on here a week ago that was posting their alpha site invitations to do some correlations and exploratory data analysis. It'd be fun to do a bespoke custom solution for someone, but they'd have to have a serious desire and budget to see it through. I guess it depends on what the potential returns for optimization in their life is.

I've been tracking all my expenses for the past 4 months. Since I only eat out, my eating habit and schedule can be inferred through my spending (i.e., I bought a burger therefore I ate a burger).

Until now, I've been using a spreadsheet to track things, but it's awkward and inconvenient to fill on my phone. I recently switched to a basic text-based journal, but I'm not sure if it's the best way forward. I still need to figure out how to process the inputs and add meaning to them.

Is there a better way to track this stuff? Is there a good way to process this list and turn it into usable metrics?Well, you could structure it more, then you could process it.

I think the major issue will be that you will spend a lot of time tracking things manually. It makes sense to automate as much as possible.

Another thing is that you will at some point notice something you haven't tracked before, but may be interesting to have. I had this several times a day when I started tracking some things using Nomie.

Yet another thing is that your data will at some point become fuzzy. Where do you draw the line when stuff happens in parallel?

    14:00         14:30         15:00
    | watching netflix |
                 | lying on couch |

It's really best to chose a purpose for what you want to track all that stuff and focus on what you **have to** track. The holistic approach is not very fun or viable.

I use mySymptoms and notepad++ on small laptop with date-times stamp attachment. Everything after first event after time stamp is one minute after previous event so I don't stamp as often. Its not as accurate but still useful. 

I am working on a parser and analyzer and graph-er in R. Here is the WIP; https://github.com/ran88dom99/EverythingTrackerVizual download One_report.nb.html to see results so far

\- I'd include tags like ""#meal"" in your log to make it easier to retrieve certain kinds of events.

\- Having the current time zone offset in the timestamp makes answering questions such as ""what's my average good night time and how has it changed"" a lot easier, especially if you ever travel or move into a different time zone.

\- If you can narrow down your tracking to a few predefined categories, an app like Nomie, KeepTrack, or Tap Log might work for you.

\- If you find a simple app that lets you log timestamped text (with hashtag completion) and photos, I'd love to hear about it!

Better yet, is there a device that would permanently show me the vitamin/mineral levels in my blood? I do understand that it would have to be ""attached"" to my body permanently somehow!

Want to reiterate that having a goal behind the data you're tracking is much more manageable and useful than just tracking purely for tracking's sake (specifically if it's manual tracking).

Say you want to learn about how social media usage affects your sleep, track your usage and track your sleep for a bit and see if the numbers are correlated. Also it's fun to track whether or not implemented activities are working. For example I like to track my productivity and whether or not using a schedule is working. 

I've also enjoy tracking things like my outlook on life (negative to positive), how confident I feel.

One of the biggest problems I've found with QS is the variability of recording methods and consistency over the years. I've been using RT since 02013, but as you mention, the incorporation of mobile changes the data a lot compared to desktop.

Additionally, Nomie has been one of my stand-bys for the past 2+ years, but the regularity of things that I track vs the quality of the data is inconsistent. From my time in research I know that basic stats are gonna reveal more about the nature of data collection rather than the patterns that they represent.

People often feel more able to make ratings if they come up with the things to be rated themselves.  So, a standard depression rating scale might have categories like Sadness and Lack of Motivation, and depressed people rating themselves in those scales might give themselves a lot of middle-of-the-scale ratings just because those terms are sort of global.  But people often have their own terms and markers for, say, depressed feelings, and generally feel pretty able to rate their mood using one of their own terms and markers. Examples, from people I know: “that heavy chest feeling” — “convinced I sound like a fool when I say something at work.”
The  way to use this idea in your app would be to have people come up with terms meaningful to them as labels for whatever rating scales your app provides. 

I use Nomie for myself and my clients. But I don't like the statistics as much, so I export them and mess with spreadsheets.

I use Daylio for journaling and mood/activity tracking. It's pretty much without fault.

I have anxiety, and one psychologist I saw explicitly told me not to track my anxiety level on a day-to-day basis, because it would just lead me to focus and ruminate on it more. I think that was good advice, at least for me.

I realize that that might be an unpopular opinion in this sub, and it probably doesn't apply to everyone equally. So I don't mean to imply that your app is a bad idea. But I would urge you to consider pairing whatever kind of symptom tracking you're creating with something like a [gratitude journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal) as well, so that users don't exclusively focus on the negative. Some studies suggest that this kind of journaling may positively affect mental health.

I want one that tracks and predicts menstrual cycles as well.  Super annoying to have to use 2 apps to do it, and most apps to track cycles seem to be geared for fertility.  If you have a mood disorder and a uterus, knowing that you want to die because you're a day before your period is awesome.   


I'm using Daylio right now and I really like it except for this missing piece. I like that I can track activities and edit/customize the activities.  The tracking helps remind me to do health-seeking behaviours. Like I'll see the little icon that says ""talk to friends today?"" and I'll be all, ""oh i haven't talked to anyone in a couple days, I should check in""

&#x200B;

I use notepad++ because if I type in ""stom"" it will immediately suggest stomach-ache. My second favorite app is mySymptoms. Its very customizable so mood could easily be added.

There is actually a really good migraine app out there which I really liked the layout off - I don't suffer from them myself but admired the UI and UX. 

Nice landing page, have you got much traction out of interest?

Wish you the best of luck with your app :)



In my pain category you can customise your own symptoms and choose the rating for that on a scale of 1-10, so this could provide the possibility for that. I'm trying to make the app as customisable as possible 

What do you do if you ever want to compare people? Or give data to your doctor through openmhealth.org? Maybe try to combine all the qualitative earmarks into one scale and hopefully every user's scale will match up in  order if not interval. 


It's a great app, really nice visually too.  However, I find it too simple personally.  My app will have more of a focus on mood, anxiety and physical symptoms, and finding patterns between these and other factors such as sleep, diet and exercise, all of which you choose a rating for overall for the day.  There will also be a gratitude element.  I think this can also lead to more interesting stats, rather than the simple mood rating stats and what activities are linked to your mood on Daylio.  

This is actually the reason I am making this app, as I found other apps were either too simple like Daylio, or too complicated (often trying to also make the app a meditation or mindfulness app in addition to journal and tracker).

I understand that concern, which is one of the reasons I only allow one anxiety entry per day, to encourage the user to think of the day as a whole and gain perspective rather than get caught up in the moment of an anxiety spell and feel like the whole day was negative as a result of what might have been just a bad 20 minutes.  If you didn't really feel any anxiety then you would not enter it, you would just enter your mood and other factors like exercise, sleep, diet etc...  

I think it can be very useful to see what physical symptoms are caused by anxiety, as well as what activities and other factors such as diet, sleep and exercise make it worse or better, as the more knowledge we have about this, the more we can do to help it in the future.

And yes, good point, I already have gratitude as one of the main features and there is also a mindfulness factor I have included with a breathing exercise. 

Maybe have warning at start mention that psychologist's suggestion then an option to reduce anxiety like that in user settings.



I'm not sure if our mood tracking would be a good replacement for Daylio, but my app [Exist](https://exist.io/) includes custom tags so you can add a tag for every day you're menstruating (or separate tags for spotting, cramps, period, etc.) and we can help you correlate that to your mood. In future we'd like to sync menstruation data from other services like Apple Health so you don't have to rely on tags but we don't have an ETA on that yet.

I like Daylio but it was too simple for me.  That's why I wanted to make an app where you can also rate your anxiety and physical symptoms, along with more detail about sleep, diet, exercise etc, that way it's easier to spot more patterns and the stats become more intereting in my opinion.

&#x200B;

With regards to tracking menstrual cycles I'm not surprised Daylio doesn't do it, as there are much better apps that do so, and if the creator is anything like me, I do not know enough about them, so I'd feel like a bit of a fraud!

I'm trying to make something a bit less ""clinical"" looking and feeling, something more personable, which has gratitude and mindfulness elements too.

Just started marketing a little so not much yet. The few users I have tend to use it daily though. I’d love for more feedback from someone else who is thinking about similar ideas. 

That sounds good. You might consider letting people make up a couple idiosyncratic scales in the anxiety and depression categories too.  

Custom made personal scales aren't useful if you want to compare people with each other.  But in many situations, and this is one, what's of interest is variation over time of mood in one person.  As for giving info to your doctor -- well, doctors have their own methods of deciding *whether* you are depressed, generally some standard questions about emotional states, sleep, energy, self-hatred, hopelessness etc.  They don't decide whether you are depressed based on some scale score you send them.  Once it is established in their minds that you are depressed, though, I think any reasonable doctor would be interested in a reported improvement or worsening of depression, with evidence of the report being changes in score on an individually-designed scale.

That sounds great, especially the integration of gratitude and mindfulness (I try to practice both of those things every day). But part of Daylio's appeal is its simplicity. I haven't missed a day in over two years of using it because it's so simple and enjoyable. If there were many more functions, it would be easy to fall of the wagon, especially if you're depressed. So my advice is - having a ton of functions is great but in my opinion, simplicity and ease of use is of higher priority. Good luck with the project! :)

> and finding patterns between these and other factors such as sleep, diet and exercise, all of which you choose a rating for overall for the day. 

your are far better off exporting to zenobase or exist.io or openhumans.org



I guess I've just customized it to track my personal wonky brain, but yes, it would be great to come with more stuff. Sleep/diet/exercise is important too. I've just added them to my daylio and use the notes to fill it out. You're right though, it could be less cumbersome. As soon as you have to start customizing the hell out of something and tryign to find work-arounds it becomes annoying.   


re cycles: It's not super complicated. I'm not an app developer, but cycles themselves aren't super complicated and many of the apps let you put in when you start and stop, and after a while it gets to know your patterns. Maybe that's more than one app can do?  I feel like it doesn't have to be,. 

&#x200B;

Well if you ever have a lot of options have the most commonly used in the past week at the top please. 

With regards to anxiety I thought it was weird to rate individual ""types"", I thought it would be more useful to put an overall anxiety score and then pick the things that triggered it.  However with physical symptoms (which could result from anxiety) you can rate as many different personalised things as you want.

&#x200B;

If you want to PM me your email I can notify you when the app is complete?

Thanks

The combined earmarks scale would be a suggestion for users to make their own. If user picks qualitative earmarks in the same order as combined earmarks scale that will help. 

> doctors have their own methods of deciding whether you are depressed, generally some standard questions about emotional states, sleep, energy, self-hatred, hopelessness etc.

Isn't  this the same as a combined earmarks scale? 

Haha yes that is actually my main issue right now, I have so many ideas, but I'm trying to think from the users perspective and I want to keep it as simple as possible, which is why it's a fine balancing act!   

In terms of journaling, I'm going to make it so basically you can make it as simple or as complex as your want (so an entry might take 10 seconds or 10 minutes depending on how much you want to enter), but in terms of visually I'd like it to be very simple that's for sure. I find there are so many apps out there that mean well, giving you so many options, but I am instantly put off an app with so many buttons and features, especially the ones that try to be journaling apps and meditation apps at the same time, it's just too much to take in.

Would you like me to add you to my mailing list and notify you when the app is done?  :)

I will definitely look into it and think about adding it as a feature in the future when I'm more settled.

&#x200B;

How about just notify me with a Reddit PM? I’m not crazy about idea of giving out my email address to anyone on Reddit. No offense intended. 

Yeah, I guess you have to determine if your audience is the general public or the quantified self community and nerds like us. I guess Daylio has already covered the general public so it would make sense to cater to a niche audience. And maybe you should make the distinction between the core experience and the extra features. But I know nothing about app making so I'm not going to pretend I do. :)

Sure, I'll shoot you a PM!

sure thing. I'd love to see it.

No I completely understand :)

Good point.  I'm hoping by keeping it simple on the face of it but adding the ability to rate other factors, in addition to the gratitude and mindfulness elements, it will set me apart from Daylio :)

I feel like food clearly has a huge impact on how we feel day-to-day. Some of these might be hidden medical conditions like not knowing you’re lactose intolerant or something, but I feel this is true of a lot of random foods I’m not actually allergic to, e.g. I always feel just slightly gross and inflamed after eating certain seafood, or my friends tell me they definitely have certain acne trigger foods. Why isn’t there a way for food / macro trackers to help figure out which foods are correlated with feeling meh -- without having to try and piece together these patterns ourselves, or doing a full-on elimination diet (I tried that for a bit, and eating parsnips for two weeks straight just \_sucked\_)?

I think I want to build something that can help me track how I feel during the day (and for me, whether I have skin breakouts) compared to just the ingredients in the food I eat, but I’m also wondering if maybe there’s already some good research or information about this that I couldn’t find yet. Most trackers just seem kind of suboptimal for finding these kinds of patterns + just so poorly designed (must it take 5 clicks to input a simple snack?).

Final option is, if possible, to automate a reminder through a tool like Tasker, that will load my tracking app at a set time so when I open my phone after that, it will be the on-screen app. I'm new to automation so don't know if it can go as deep as actually loading up a specific screen within an app, but time will tell.  
I'm also toying with the idea of reminder email services. I could use a service like Typeform to set up my own although not sure if the data is syncable or shareable, but I've seen someone suggest using Zapier to zap the details to a Google Sheet, which can then be integrated into data pipelines.

What do you think?[Spire](https://spire.io/) has a similar device that alerts you to poor breathing. They claim to be able to detect stress, which seems more plausible in general than reliably detecting ""focus"" from breathing patterns alone.

I’ve backed 150+ projects, but I stopped a while ago. My default assumption is that any campaign on Indiegogo is either a scam, or put together by someone who won’t be able to deliver due to lack of competence. There are exceptions, but Indiegogo’s rules are very accommodating for scammers. 

Data from their original device (which only tracks breath rate and steps) is available through their API as well as Apple Health. But I don't know if additional data collected by the newer ""Health Tag"" device can be accessed as well. Doesn't look like they've updated [their API docs](https://developer.spire.io/docs/events)...

Is this all automaticly generated or do you have to combine it yourself? Very cool idea.

I'm only confused by your finance data as it seems to go back in time sometimes lol. Is it a mock-up?

Sorry this is one of the few projects I'm not open sourcing.  
Trust me you wouldn't want to read the code anyway! :p

it is sound... I record my snoring. cronjobs and scripts transcode and color the created images.  
gpodder allows you to run a script when you play a podcast. so script to launch ffmpeg.  
alarm clock program has same, so stops recording and runs scripts to store audio etc.  
also wakes up by telling me weather, unread emails and other stuff.

sure.. so.. here goes:

top right pic of me, I use ""snap me up"" as a 2nd alarm, it takes a selfie to stop the alarm, the pics make me lol

""finances"" a google spreadsheet constantly updated - create graph and can share the URL

""todo"" I use the todo.txt methodology, dropbox - same as achivements - I keep a personal achievements list.

""moodlog"" is moodlog.txt ([http://rossmarks.uk/blog/moodlog-txt/](http://rossmarks.uk/blog/moodlog-txt/))

""agenda"" is from google calendar

""read"" - from goodreads

""Entertainment"" - my HTPC uses kodi->database on NAS so get movies and tv shows from that, and get gameplay time from a program called ""gametracker""

""heart"", ""steps"" & ""weight"" all from fitbit api

don't think I've missed anything there.. hope it helps

would love to get ideas of more stuff to track

yup it's all automatic. PHP scripts and cron jobs

Drat, well thanks anyway.

China makes under 15$ wearable watches that are way better at detecting sleep than snore mics.

Do you retrieve the Fitbit data regularly and automatically? I always have to get a new key every once in a while, since I can't generate one that is permanently valid :/



 that is a blob not a graph.



it's not even a snore mic, just the inbuilt laptop mic of an old sony vaio 13"" laptop that I use as a smart alarm.

yea fitbit is all all automatic.  
use oauth2 and a cronjob every hour.  
make sure to update tokens all the time and I've never had a problem with it.  


same for the game I made - stepescape.com

Yeah, I meant the token generation. I wrote a Python script to automatically retrieve my data (also using Oauth2), but I have to keep renewing the tokens myself, so a complete automation seems not that easy, which sucks.

It would be nice to have a single script run by crontab and just pick up the data when needed :)

sorry I can't help too much there, this is all in PHP.  
theres plenty of libraries available for all languages though.. just keep up, trying different things, I'm sure you'll get it working.

Edit: I meant 2,000 pages, not 20,000!I don't think I ever achieved any New Year's resolution.

My plan for 2019 is to implement the *Getting Things Done* methodology, and to track as much as possible while traveling full time in Southeast Asia (fill every slot in my calendar, track every expense, track my position, get a smart band).

At minimum, I want to continue tracking all my expenses. I have collected ~700 entries since I started traveling in October 2018.

My New Year resolution is to start an open source software project aimed at securely and privately collecting a persons bio-markers -- essentially a personalized health monitoring platform. 



Try audiobooks. All the learning for much less effort.

I'm comitting to getting back up to 70%+ days for meditation.

Plus non-specific ""I'm going to track more thoroughly and gamify my progress""

This year I'll try to reduce my time spent online and on my phone. I use the Quality Time app to track time spent on phone and the Webtime Tracker chrome add-on to track my browsing on the laptop.

Other than that, I'll continue tracking the usual stuff like money, productive pomodoros, weight, mood, activities, at what time I got up, and so on.

Wow, that’s a lot, but that’s awesome! Is the traveling for work or fun (or both)?

But not all pages are equal! Maybe he should use words instead?

EDIT: Not all words are equal!

I’d love to see that spreadsheet! I didn’t really have any kind of system in mind, other than a simple column of pages read. But yours sounds way cooler!

Good luck with your business this year!

I know it sounds weird, but learning isn’t actually my main goal (I’ve got some purely leisure reading on my list), though it would be great. Audiobooks are a bit difficult due to some minor hearing loss.

I set reading goals for myself every year since it’s an activity I enjoy but not one I reflexively do in my spare time. Last year was the first time I fell so short of the metric but came pretty close to the real goal, which is what motivated my post.

I wasn't making progress in my life and career. I have some idea/vision/project I  want to develop. So quit my job and flew to Bangkok.

The intention was:

1. Break routine by getting out of my comfort zone.

2. Save money by living in cheap countries.

The result is:

1. I have a worse routine than I had back home.

2. I spend more money than I did back home.

I have a lot more time to think about things, and daily life without responsibilities is very relaxed, but I'm not really making the progress I predicted.

Why stop at words? Not all letters are equal!

And don’t get me started on punctuation!!!

[removed]

Man, that must have taken a lot of courage. Good luck to you!

Do you have a blog of some sort on these adventures? If so would be an interesting read.

***P I X E L S***

I understand the pragmatics of counting books and pages. It's a good, if arbitrary, way to make progress that correlates with goals you might care about. But it's probably not optimal.

What do you actually seek to gain from reading books?

- Increase your expertise? Read more research papers.

- Increase your score on GoodReads? Read more (shorter) books.

- Increase your vocabulary? Read more Shakespeare.

- Increase your perceived intelligence? Read classics.

- Increase your practical knowledge? Read more Cliff's Notes.

- Increase your open-mindedness? Read completely unrelated books.

- Increase your room's cleanliness? Read 12 Rules for Life.

- Increase your atheism? Read more religious books.

- Increase your reading speed? Read more words.

- Increase your ""number of pages read""? Read more pages...*

\* *Pro tip: Prefer small books with large text and images. Avoid audio books.*

Not at the moment.

I keep track of a lot of metrics (location history, every single purchase, every single meal, transportation, accommodations, visas, the weight of every single item I carry) and take notes of a lot of tips and tricks (mostly frugality hacks). I'm thinking about publishing most of it at some point, but it's not ready yet.

I don’t know man, I just wanna read some good books. Increased vocab, open-mindedness, etc., would be nice side benefits, but it’s not the main goal.

Not necessarily looking for an optimal measurement, but just a simple, practical one. And definitely not looking to game my own metric (as you suggest in your pro tip, you cheeky son of a gun!).

For instance, if I drink alcohol late in the evening, I'd want to be able to tag my sleep data with this so that I can later see if this correlates with more nocturnal activity over time. Otherwise I'd have to manually put the data into a spreadsheet and record my qualitative tags, which would be very time-consuming.

I've always been interested in personal EEG headsets, but I don't want one that is all about meditation or focus. I want to be able to track brainwaves to see what brainwave I am at and what other data correlates. But also, I want something that has quality apps that can help with brain-training, but especially personal growth. CBT games or exercises for example.

I know of the NeuroSky but I don't fully trust them. I can't see when the apps were created (as in, are people still producing them or has this gone stale), and the Google Play reviews are generally quite low, often complaining about the apps being in different languages.

Thanks!I wrote an [app for the NeuroSky](https://github.com/zenobase/zenobase-mindlog), but eventually gave up on it because getting a good signal was so tedious.

The Muse headband works better, and has [a research app](http://developer.choosemuse.com/tools) for monitoring raw data in real-time.

[Emotive](https://www.emotiv.com/) is another option, should be more accurate.

With all of these devices, expect the data to be noisy, and you'll need to do a lot of calibration and be able to sit perfectly still :-)

I keep looking at this for various reasons, but haven't been happy enough to take the plunge yet.

http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=mindwave_mobile_and_arduino shows how you can hook the NeuroSky up to an Arduino so you can do your usual hacking/data collection without using any of the apps.

The idea of using an EEG while doing CBT games or exercises doesn't really make a lot of sense. What would you expect the EEG to do, recognize when your thoughts or behavior is irrational in real time? However, using EEG technology to help you develop a mindfulness habit makes a lot of sense. If you're looking at it from a cognitive-behavioral perspective, Muse is good from a cognitive standpoint because it provides psychoeducation about mindfulness. From a behavioral standpoint, it provides external motivation to reinforce adaptive behaviors/habits (e.g., practicing mindfulness, developing awareness of your thoughts and emotions as they arise without judging or becoming overwhelmed by them). For example, when you use Muse  you hear birds chirping if you are being mindful, and this provides positive reinforcement for your mindfulness habit. If you are not being mindful, you might hear waves crashing louder. This provides positive punishment (e.g., a negative consequence that makes a behavior less likely to occur). Plus, just practicing mindfulness is going to make any other CBT interventions you try more effective. 

I've been using Muse for a few weeks now. I can't really tell if it's accurate or not. There's so much placebo effect going on with mindfulness. However, I do know it's gotten me meditating more.

I recommend you organize your new data by first asking questions then figure out what type of data you need to answer them. 

From my own personal experience on some days I feel mentally/physically tired but I make surprising gains in the gym. Am I not pushing myself hard enough?

Maybe I've been pushing myself harder than usual the last couple times at the gym but just didn't notice. 

If I record/add a [RPE scale](https://www.verywellfit.com/perceived-exertion-scale-1231117) along with my work out results then maybe I can get a better handle on mental vs physical challenge. 

Some other things you might want to record:

* Are you sick? How bad 1-5
* Body weight - most people do first thing in the morning
* Time between meals
* Time spent outside (0 min, 0-15min, 15-30min, 30-45min, 45-60min, 60+min)

I really like your getting after it attitude but I fear you may be inundated with data. So perhaps try to automate as much as possible of the data collection and try to get into the habit of gathering as much data as possible at a certain point throughout the day (post workout, morning, night etc) since this way you'll more likely to consistently collect/record. I also recommend collecting everything for 1 week and analyzing your results just to see how much there is/ what works what doesn't. 

One last point. I recommend simple concrete categories for example on mood I can tell the difference for myself between a 3 and 4 or a 2 and a 3 on a 1-5 scale but telling the difference between a 6/7 or 7/8 on a 1-10 scale is a lot harder and more subjective. Maybe you're more perceptive than me in which case great stick with the 10 scale but beware ""7"" might mean something different in winter vs summer where as a ""4"" might not since it's a bigger category. I also recommend making recording easy like the time spent outside metric who cares if it's exactly 26 min? Just dump it into a category and move on. Refine as required. It would be seriously costly to try and figure out *exactly* how much time you spent outside. Guessing/rounding has higher error in it sure but trading off against the time cost of data collection/data introspection is most likely worth it at this stage. If you find out that a certain metric is very predictive then it makes sense to hone in on it and get much better info on it.

Anyway good luck!

What you ate. Blood pressure. Heart-rate. Total movement. 

Many threads asking where to analyze data. Try zenobase.

If you are concerned at all about overtraining, Heart Rate Variability could be a useful metric. I recently started using [Elite HRV](https://elitehrv.com/) with an optical heart rate monitor (Scosche Rhythm24).

Sleep seems like another important metric, but I don't know if you can do better than tracking time to bed and time out of bed (plus a subjective rating). Haven't had much luck with sleep tracking devices/apps.

Finally, it can be useful to be able to go back in time to refresh your memory what places you went to on a given day. Google's Location History works well for me, though exporting the data is a pain, and there are some glitches where they randomly overwrite some of your data...

[deleted]

Memorable, concrete categorical earmarks are very important for any continuous scale. For pain I use a scale where 1 is just barely detectable, 3 is impossible to miss, 5 affects my ability to work and at 7 is my main and pressing concern. If I stick to the earmarks, the score I give the exact same amount of pain at different times may change by one point but not more.

The link [whenihittheground](https://www.reddit.com/user/whenihittheground) provides for RPE seems to agree and uses ability to talk and sweating as its earmarks.

I'm working on a project to monitor sexual pleasure.

So far, I'm monitoring heart rate and galvanic skin response, but I'd be interested to know what else you all think I should measure?

The sensors are all esp8266-based, allowing me to send data via WiFi connections back to a central processing platform, so home brew is definitely an option (possibly preferred).

I was thinking about getting a neurosky mind wave and add some brainwave monitoring,but I'm open to any other options.

The only real criteria is that is has to be small enough/unobtrusive enough to be worn comfortably.

Thanks in advance. Apparently (cant remember the exact paper), but the woman orgasm caisea the brain to partially shut down amd reset. I wonder if an EEG node could give some extra data.

With other quantified self experiments I overlay multiple sensors and tests.

Eg subjectively grading orgasms then working back to check that HR and other tests actually correlate.

There is a pedo test which is a cock ring that sits at the base of a flassid cock. They are shown different pics and can see the change in temp and bloodflow. Some weird other sensors could also work eg if wrist blood low drops maybe that is cause it is going somewhere else.

Temp would be interesting and an IR external cam may pick that up as measurable.

Breath rhythm, depth and tempo is probably a sign of a good one coming. 

Quivering thighs is usually a good sign.

I also suspect blood pressure could be relevant also.

Op in the lab https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bttf/images/7/7c/Doc-mindreader.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080916000813

I assume it has something like a Fitbit integrated already? 

How are you monitoring heart rate and galvanic skin response? I've been kind of interested in continuous monitoring of those as well.

What are you trying to measure exactly? The presence of pleasure, the degree of pleasure, or if an orgasm is happening?

If it's not degree, then the way I would do it would be to collect data with just heartrate and galvanic skin response and look at the graphs. Sex is super obvious from just heartrate (though if you have to distinguish it from other physical activity, you might need to be clever). Masturbation has a elevated heartrate too, I'm pretty sure.

Nice.

Temperature was on my list, hadn't thought about breathing rate etc though.

I'm away of the penile plesmethograph (""dick hardness"" as someone else so eloquently put it! ;) ), but I'm led to believe that it's quite unreliable :(

I'm wondering if an EMG in the thighs might be good for measuring muscle spams though. 

You know it... :D

Kind of (see comment above about HR/GSR), but the data on all of the commercial trackers is pretty difficult to pull in real time, so I have some esp8266 and ESP32 devices which pull the data from the sensors and feed it all into a message queue for analysis by a raspberry pi. 

Using a heart rate and a galvanic skin response sensor! ;)

https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/ad8232-heart-rate-monitor-hookup-guide/all is the heart rate sensor, and whilst I'm not using the full functionality in theory I can monitor the entire QRS of a heartbeat.

http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-GSR_Sensor/ is the GSR sensor, but I'm thinking about replacing the finger cuffs with sticky electrodes so I can position them more discretely and still monitor GSR without impeding finger movement. 

It's basically points 1 & 3.

The idea is that a computerised system can analyse real-time data feeds and use that to control devices attached to the system for giving pleasure,so if you want an orgasm in 5 minutes it will do that, if you'd rather it took hours, then it will monitor your vital signs and keep you just away from orgasm until you reach the alloted time etc.

I'm working on the machine learning side of things as well, but I want to see if there's any other data out there that might be worth collecting. 

The approach could be scientific eg set multiple measurement tools, test each and compare to the subjective grading (which is probably the most accurate?) then seeing most accurate correlation. 

The fact that biologically males and females are doing different things means likely different measurement tools?

In all seriousness though good luck!!

No accelerometer? That's more what I was asking about. 

This might be a bit less invasive, easier to install heart rate monitor:
https://pulsesensor.com/products/pulse-sensor-amped
Either way, your heart rate monitor seems like it should be able to measure HRV so there's no reason not to track that as well.

For GSR, I believe the palms are the most indicative of amygdala based arousal. You might also want to measure body temp, preferably core, and decorrelate that from the GSR to better measure arousal.

Blood pressure seems like an obvious indicator. After that, perhaps respiration rate, pulse oximetry (although it might get in the way), and maybe some accelerometers attached to or near relevant locations.

I'm pretty interested in this project, maybe we should talk some more...

Sounds like you don't want to measure ""sexual pleasure"" but rather ""closeness to orgasm"". This seems very difficult, and you have to have some pretty involved models if you wanted to do machine learning this, because the model would have to encode your current orgasm-proximity at every timestep. If you just want an edging machine, then just record your data while you edge yourself manually, labeling if you are below the edge, on the edge, or orgasming. Then turn those into the numbers 0, 1 , 2 and train a regression model and optimize it to always keep you at a 1.

No, I'm not interested in ""thrusts"" etc, this is more about the physiological state of the body.

The intent is to take all of the data and create an AI model that can be used to ""train"" adult toys to give the user the best possible orgasm, and it's targeted at people with female bodies, meaning that existing studies are few and far between.

I did look at using a 10dof gyroscope to analyse potential body positions, so I guess the accelerometer might help with that... 

Heh, the reason for using the ECG rather than those is that I've worked in healthcare in the past and the finger-pulse sensors have a habit of dropping off.  I'd not thought about tracking HRV as well as the HR itself, so thanks.

As far as discussing it further is concerned, there's not much more to it that what I've already outlined.

I'm still deciding whether to open-source this or sell it (or a combination of both!) so I can't give too many more details, but if I ever get it all working I'll definitely post a writeup of what and how I'm capturing :)

Heh, I'll happily take both a ""pleasure index"" and an ""orgasm threshold"".

As I say, I've got a lot of the code written already, I was more interested in what others might measure alongside HR and GSR.

It's not just for edging, it's to explore/develop/propose new things that the user might not have tried before as well

This isn't quantified self really then, you want more /r/biohacking or similar I think. 

Cool, thanks.

I figured the analysis etc was probably quantself, so re coked that folks here would know the best sensors to use etc, but I'm happy to take the conversation elsewhere if that's more appropriate. 


The analysis seems more diybio too, because the results aren't communicated to a human user, they're fed back into a control system on the toy. 

I hope you get useful feedback in both places, but if you ask ""what would you want in a QS product for sex,"" you're asking a question that I think you aren't interested in the answer to, because your product isn't really QS, it's a sex toy with biofeedback.

However, it's still a long way until this will be somewhat usable. Until then I am looking for a way to make a small visual summary for this year. I am not afraid of programming, but the easier/the less time consuming the better.

&#x200B;

As this is the first year I am taking data collection serious, I don't have that much data. I only have the data from RescueTime, Toggl, a list of dates that I have meditated and the books I have read on Goodreads.

Just to give you an idea what capabilities I might need, what I am imaging is trying to make an area chart from the time data from RescueTime and Toggl (ideally with smoothing). I would then like to add the dates where I meditated (maybe as an box that is filled for each day I meditated) and the dates where I finished a book (maybe even with the book covers) below the area chart with the same date-X-axis. 

&#x200B;

 I already have the data from RescueTime and Toggle in form of an excel sheet. However I could't find a way to add the boolean data (mediation/book dates). So my question: Which tools do you guys use? It would be great if I could reuse and expand it with the new data I am going to collect 2019. Thank you very much!Sounds like a really specific graph, but the data is relatively straightforward. You could code a lot of it just using the ggplot package in R, but the book covers would probably need to be added to the image with a photo editor (maybe R could do this. I've never tried.)

&#x200B;

I think the most robust graphing tool right now is D3 I have never used it and I hear the learning curve is really steep. But you could look into that tool as well. 

Once the data aggregation and processing is sorted out, [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/) can be used to visualize several data series with multiple attributes each on a timeline. Pandas + [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) if you need more flexibility. [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) if you are building a website (I used this library for all the charts on [Zenobase](https://zenobase.com/)).

What sorts of things would you advise for someone starting to get involved in this, who had the intention of building their own system to help with this?

&#x200B;

Thoughts so far - there are a lot of separate apps and resources for tracking specific things, like calorie and exercise trackers, productivity stuff, health and wearable devices etc, but I wanted to build something that aggregates the entire lot, and uses data analytics to try and draw interesting results if lots of areas of data were collected. I know some artificial intelligence, but it be possible with simpler stuff, I'll see how it turns out. I'll want to interface with it through an app / website, and I'm thinking of getting cloud server stuff for running the data collection, storage, and number crunching.

&#x200B;

Of course it'll be quite a large project, but the best thing about this topic is it's very modular, I can see immediate progress from hooking in an api from my calendar, or wifi connected scales that measure lots of different things somehow, or movement tracking software, one step at a time, and build up.

&#x200B;

Is anyone aware of any good open source projects doing something similar or that could include useful features for this? Even professional software that I can use for inspiration would be great.

&#x200B;

Thanks![deleted]

I am working on this. So far I just use R and lots of cognitive tracking websites. Most resources do not export their info or even allow an API  and that means either hacking or using resources that do allow export. Please help by finding or compiling a list of tracking devices that allow export. The smart phone owners both have apps that aggregate from a few of their apps and wearables. I mean Google Fit.

&#x200B;

The free and open source R language is the best visualization and statistics tool. It has packages/libraries that allow doing the visualization and stats through point and click interfaces that also make code user can add to scripts. [https://alternativeto.net/list/2063/guis-to-save-from-typing-r-code/](https://alternativeto.net/list/2063/guis-to-save-from-typing-r-code/) It can deal with csv and JSON. (and I am sure XML). Maybe then learn Python to do API and cloud and production stuff.

Welcome to QS! 

I like your idea of starting your own project. Sorry for being a downer, but I would suggest considering other ideas than such a platform. I personally know many people (individuals, entrepreneurs, and academics) all trying to build their own platforms for real-time data aggregation and inference. Unless you just want to improve your coding skills, I'd move to a less crowded space.

If you ever wanted to brainstorm, ping me here or via a PM!

Zenobase by Eric Jain is a great model to look at if you want an example. He's been at it a long time and hangs out on the QS Forum - he's typically willing to answer questions and share ideas. There are a lot of hidden barriers to doing this well, some of them placed in your way intentionally by consumer wearables makers to keep others from building services for their users that will compete in some way; others just there because what you call ""the entire lot"" is actually a mishmash of all kinds of random approaches that aren't that easy to systematize. (We've had full sessions at QS conferences just on hangups in data integration related to handling time.) Anyway, Zenobase is [here](https://zenobase.com). Link to an old discussion about building something like this is [here](https://forum.quantifiedself.com/t/omnier-com-new-api-aggregator/3969) \- most of these people are still on the forum I think.

Perfect, I'll take a look

Thank you! I was hoping java for the data collection and then considering python for the data crunching, I don't know much about front end stuff to be honest for actual graph visualisation

Ah I thought the QS area wouldnt be too overcrowded yet, but I suppose people are coming at it from all sorts of different angles, and things like Fitbit and my fitness Pal are working their way towards it.

Hmm, oh well, I wanted to build myself one anyway since it'll be infinitely customisable and I can get exactly what I want done, so I'll go ahead anyway.

Thank you very much!

Great thanks!

Each rectangle is 30 minutes, color coded from cyan (around 60 bpm) to red (120 bpm). Each day is a row and starts at bedtime. As such, sleep is always on the left. Little white marks divide sleep from wake. I keep a very consistent sleep schedule 


The chart shows average heart rate over those 30 minutes, and this is not a fitness training app, as such, lower heart rate is better. 

There are 3 charts total - raw heart rate, steps and combined chart called “stress”

So far it correlates nicely with my work load - last month was very heavy. I’m trying to revert the trend and only over the last couple days got my heart rate to return to cyan during the night (no caffeine after noon)

Hello,

I've recently tried to quantify my study time and I am a newbie at all this. 

The beginning: 

Using Todoist Task Manager: I copied all my class assignments, test dates and study strategy into Todoist.

https://i.redd.it/nofmmdrxtqv11.png

Toggl: I had no way to quantify how many hours I'm spending on each task until I heard about Toggl. I was able to integrate with Todoist. So every time I start a task, I click on ""start timer"" (as seen above) in Todoiest and it would automatically calculate the time spent on my homework assignment and import it into the Toggl application (as seen below). Toggl will allow me to export this data in a .csv or .xls file. This is great! I'm making progress!

https://i.redd.it/o75i72pytqv11.png

&#x200B;

Here is where I run into trouble. With all this data collected, I want to visually see what I've accomplished, how much I've completed and see how much behind/ ahead I am in my class. The closest I can muster up is using a Gantt Chart I purchased on [Veretex42.com](http://veretex42.com/). I had to manually place the same tasks and due dates on my Todoist and as I progressed, I had to manually change the %Done field. The result was a fancy Gantt chart, but, there is so much room for manual error (e.g. incorrect copy & past of formulas), and there's so many steps to get what I want: I gantt chart or some variation of it.

https://i.redd.it/p0i292pztqv11.png

Does anyone have any suggestions? Do any of you know of an integration with Toggl that would provide me something similar to this gantt chart where it would show me visually how much ahead I am or behind I am?

I'm kind of getting the feeling that I need a new doctor, yeah. I mean it's not like I'm asking for a drug, and I'm paying cash for it not going through insurance. She literally said ""it's a matter of me trying to convince the pharmacist that you need it and then convincing myself. "" 🙄🙄🙄 LOL the pharmacist doesn't care he would fill the script. And also my health concerns are valid even if I'm not a ""brittle diabetic."" 

Thanks for your comment. 

Out of curiosity how low have you seen yourself?

[deleted]

Oh. I would advise getting a cheap device at CVS or something first to test that it is actually low blood sugar first. Lots of things can mimic it, and it would provide stronger evidence to your Dr. If you test yourself every time you're feeling a low, and the numbers are normal then it is probably not hypoglycemia. It would probably be excessive to jump to a cgm if you have never documented an actual instance of low blood sugar. 

Take it from me, I suffer from panic attacks and low blood sugar problems. I bought a regular meter at the pharmacy to document the lows. It helped me document lows (which I was getting often), but also it helped me realize what feelings were more associated with panic attacks, or just having too much coffee.

Intelligence is considered to be a stable construct, so I don't know if there would be any benefit to measuring it regularly. 

For other aspects of cognition, the links provided by zenobase look really cool.

If you'd like to measure mood, I would recommend the app [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com/), which can send you random prompts throughout the day for you to track your mood. Very customizable, so you can create your own constructs, set the Likert scale to whatever range you want, etc. 

How many pages can your read in 10 minutes. How fast can you memories 20 cards.  I am looking into some version of solitaire SET right now. it has a daily timed puzzle [http://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle](http://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle)

also

[https://www.humanbenchmark.com/](https://www.humanbenchmark.com/)

I write results in notation like 11N for how many numbers I can remember then parse and graph them with R. Its odd they do not export for the QS community. I wish to get more stats out of each test like how many wrong how much hesitation; they could matter.

&#x200B;

IMHO best option would be a language training app for for short term and long term memorization AND you actually learn a language.

&#x200B;

Maybe randomized quizzes and puzzles based on some existing research? 

What are the links provided by zenobase?

Thank you for the kind response by the way!

I could certainly craft some ideas. I'll send a PM

Interested. What ""results"" would you compare to pubmed?

Hi Loony, I'm not 'hungrycantaloupe', though reading his post that you mentioned does seem on similar thinking.   
What part of what I've said seems like garbage? We've assessed the feasibility of what we want to achieve, so its not sci-fi, I just wanted to talk to people who love monitoring their own self-health what they would love to see.

The lack of useful predictions isn't the fault of 23andMe, it's a reflection of how little we know; even getting your full genome sequenced and using a service like [Promethease](https://promethease.com/) to get a more comprehensive list of relevant literature won't help much.

Old model = symptoms i.e. disease has set in and is causing symptoms, condition based interview i.e. clerking, treatment i.e. side effects

New model = Predictive simulation (user data i.e. genetics, real time physiology tracking) + deep learning of clinical literature (artificial intelligence data mining) allows for predictive simulation and prevention, no disease, and a user-centric model (not a condition-centric one)

&#x200B;

To create a predictive model now one can string together the following:

\- Genetic data

\- Regular biomarker tracking (gold standard blood)

\- Real time physiology tracking

\- Utilise personal data and hope for an artificial intelligence deep learning of the entire clinical literature (IBM Watson etc). 

&#x200B;

Would a united consumer product that fuses the above be a breakthrough - it would dematerialise, democratise and decentralise preventative medicine and it would be user centric and personalised. A user interface allowing for easy understanding (potentially artificial intelligence natural language synthesis and voice interface would be good). 

&#x200B;

Please share your thoughts - the above are my thoughts of the future. Sure. The catch is that no one has enough data to build those predictive models yet. Companies like [Arivale](https://www.arivale.com/), [Project Baseline](https://www.projectbaseline.com/), and [Human Longevity](https://www.humanlongevity.com/) are on it...

Love the idea and I have been thinking about this myself for a long time. Problems lie in the individuality and lack of general data for these models.

Each facet of self-quantification is currently run by a different company. Companies with the data do not want to share it because it is a core competitive advantage of theirs. As the consumer we are left with disparate data.

I did Quantified Self back in 2017 but took a break in 2018 because I didn’t give much thought behind how I was going to use the data I was recording. I was recording data in lots of different format and places which made it extremely difficult to look back at the data. Now I’ve got a more streamlined plan in place, but I’m still looking for the right tool to visualize all of the data I’m tracking. I’ll be keeping it all in a Google Sheet. 

Any suggestions?If you can code - Flexdashboard is easy to use, R has rock solid packages for pulling data out of google sheets, processing it, and plotting it. Plus - app will be responsive so will look great on any device.  

Python also has great tools, that might be easier to scale, but R’s probably easier for starting out. 

You can also deploy it for free on shinyapps, or via your own shiny server.  

Google Sheets directly. Either build a sheet with conditional color formatting. Or use the charts feature.

Visualize as in ""I need some cool charts to show random strangers"", or are their specific trends and correlations you want to understand? ;-)

Google Data Studio is by far the best option right now. It integrates directly and easily into Google Sheets, and it's free. It has some limitations but works well for dashboards.

Out of curiosity, what do you keep in those google sheets? :)

FineReport reporting software will help [you.It](https://you.It) pretty support mobile end,of course,iphone,ipad.

About visualization

FineReport, with more than 60 chart styles, basically covers all the basic charts on the market. It is a self-developed HTML5 chart with excellent dynamic effects and powerful interactive experience. When used, it can set various characteristics according to requirements, and on the mobile phone side, the LED large screen can also be adaptively displayed.  
About some visualization effects  
FineReport currently has special effects such as auto refresh, chart switching, and data highlighting, all of which are developed according to the actual needs of users. In addition, there is a group of hobby developers behind Fansoft (the parent company of Finereport), which will use visual open source. Library, design and development visualization plug-in, customized for finereport, the current ecosystem is very mature.  
This is its official website:[http://www.finereport.com/en/](http://www.finereport.com/en/)

Thank you for these suggestions!

Yeah this might be what I end up doing. Thanks!

the latter

Lots of data points! In 2017 I had a long Google Form with questions about my day that I’d answer every night before bed. For instance: did you walk the dog? did you work on your book? how many words did you write? how social were you today? satisfied with your bedtime? how good was today? did you read a book? etc etc. The responses would automatically populate a Google Sheet. 

Hey, aknavi, just a quick heads-up:  
**curiousity** is actually spelled **curiosity**. You can remember it by **-os- in the middle**.  
Have a nice day!

> Human health is dependent upon environmental exposures, yet the diversity and variation in exposures are poorly understood. We developed a sensitive method to monitor personal airborne biological and chemical exposures and followed the personal exposomes of 15 individuals for up to 890 days and over 66 distinct geographical locations. We found that individuals are potentially exposed to thousands of pan-domain species and chemical compounds, including insecticides and carcinogens. Personal biological  and  chemical  exposomes  are  highly dynamic and vary spatiotemporally, even for individuals located in the same general geographical region. Integrated analysis of biological and chemical exposomes revealed strong location-dependent relationships. Finally, construction of an exposome interaction network demonstrated the presence of distinct yet interconnected human- and environment-centric clouds, comprised of interacting ecosystems such as human, flora, pets, and arthropods. Overall, we demonstrate that human exposomes are diverse, dynamic, spatiotemporally-driven interaction networks with the potential to impact human health.

I'll give it a shot. I've been falling out of nomie lately because I'm not getting much worth out of it anymore, mostly bc the charts don't look very good. Within the app I think. 

RescueTime is a great tool for tracking what applications and websites you're spending your time on, but when it comes to phone use, **frequency** (i.e. number of unlocks) is a more relevant metric than time spent, at least for me...

This is untrue. ""Ego depletion"" research has not replicated consistently. It's just a folk-tale.

Nomie 3 takes a different and more flexible approach to stats. I’m actively working on the android version. But you can see the progress at http://nomie.app/blog/nomie-3-for-android-progress

True, but the success rate for changing behavior with nothing but ""willpower"" is quite low for most people...

They are working on nomie 3,which will have a better format they said a while back. If I hear about the release I'll look into it again. Thanks 😊.

It might even allow you to have Siri log events on your behalf.

The key concept is as follows:

Subjective metrics (e.g. happiness) alone aren’t very consistent or reliable data points. Objective metrics (e.g. distance run) are great for statistical analysis but don’t yet exist for many of the things we care about. To get around that, we use markers or proxies of the things we care about. I argue that a combination of subjective and objective metrics is a powerful tool in gaining insights.

The latest version of my personal tracking framework has around 40 data points for both Subjective Productivity Rating (SPR) and for Deep Work hours.

On their own, neither is a very good indicator of how productive I’ve really been. SPR is subject to bias, flawed perceptions and the inherent noisiness of quantifying a psychological experience, whilst Deep Work hours are only a reference point for how productive I was. Both are great things to track individually, but together they allow me a deeper understanding of my perceptions and a glimpse at the underlying “true” productivity I’m achieving.

As a new member, but longtime self-tracker (3 years now), I always welcome feedback from the community — especially from anyone who tracks similar metrics or has suggested improvements to my setup.

Then explore the tools people suggest and try to answer them. I think its really important to have a good question that you really want the answer to, the motivation there will help you power through fiddling with excel/tableau until you can answer it. 

For visualisation, check out Tableau. I didn't use it yet but only heard good things about it. Importantly, if you use the free version, your graphs will be available online. Hence you might think about what data to visualize with Tableau.

Now, for exploratory analysis, you could first of check how the values development in the last years by plotting them one by one.
Are they now the same level than they used to be?
How is the variance in there (Is the plot a straight line or has it many ups and downs?)?
Do the values change based on the season/month/week day?

Perhaps you find something that surprises you. Then you could apply more sophisticated methods. For now, however, I'd start with these ridiculously simple plots, because for ""real"" analyses, you most oftenly need a research question in the beginning.

I already found out that I don't mind being stressed if I am fairly productive as well. Also, there is no difference of contentment levels between work days and weekends as long as the work day is productive. However I hate unproductive stressful workdays (duh), and unproductive days in general. However I should mention that for me productivity means to do something deliberately - be it getting work done, chores, or just taking the time to do nothing or watch netflix because I really wanted to watch that show.. it has to feel like I am doing it because i want to do it.

We're the creators of an app called Fabric. It's an iOS app that does similar stuff to Moves, but with less of a focus on fitness, and more on indexing your life by people, places and events.   

We figured you guys might want to take us for a spin. You can get the app here [http://get.fabric.me](http://get.fabric.me/), and import Moves data here: [http://api.fabric.me/moves](https://api.fabric.me/moves) (or via the app).  


Let us know if we can answer questions or if you have feature requests for an app like ours. 

Any plans for an Android release?

Hi! I'm the developer of Arc App, so probably a competitor. I like to keep up with other apps doing similar things, and I've been enjoying Fabric so far! Just wanted to say I like what you've done with it 😄

I especially like how you've got photos into the timeline. If I ever get any spare time, I want to steal some of your ideas there 😂

I also really like the way you've put a shortlist of likely place names directly in the timeline. That's some nice UI work!

On a more technical level, I'm curious what technologies you're using for the visit and trip detection. It looks like it's higher accuracy than CLVisits?

I'm not a massive fan of the way the timeline snaps onto each item. But that's possibly just a familiarity thing. I've heard from a few Moves users with complaints about some of the UI choices I've made in Arc, when what they really mean most of the time is that it's different and they haven't settled into the change yet. 

Should the link above be [https://api.fabric.me/moves](https://api.fabric.me/moves)?

What options do you have for exporting data?

We do, but our app needs some extra tweaking to play well on Android, and we don’t want to release it before the experiences are comparable. 

Hey man, we’re fans of your app as well!

We have our own custom library we wrote from scratch that does better than CLVisit for our purposes. We found that CLVisit is too delayed, and a lot of other SDKs out there require us to give them access to user data, which we didn’t want to do.



Hi u/zenobase,

That link helps you import your data, but you can also do it in the app itself. Thanks for pointing that out!  


We have an API that isn't public yet, but for now we've been helping folks get their data manually if they would like. With some abuse protection etc we hope to release the API soon so you can do it yourself.

That's very wise! So I'll just keep on waiting for the Android version, hope I can play with it soon... wish you success.

Do you have a ballpark timeline for release?

Yeah I think everyone quickly realises that CLVisit is inadequate at best. The delay and inaccuracy make it unusable for most tasks. 

There’s the expectation that this sort of thing can be built quickly and easily with existing CoreLocation and CoreMotion tools, but it’s really not the case. 

Which SDKs require user data?

It's under active development! Unfortunately that's all we can say right now.

With an app like ours, making sure the quality is good on the various different android devices is the real test.

Just import your data into Gyroscope and keep on truckin. Their import tool worked flawlessly.

Google's Timeline feature works as well as Moves, if not better, and you may already have it enabled. The only drawback is that Google still doesn't let you export your data (apart from raw coordinates).

3.5 years ago, I landed my first (and current) job as a marine engineer. I have tracked my happiness every single day during this entire time, and recorded the days that were positively and negatively influenced by my work.

Being an engineer, I have used this data to try and find exactly how much I like my work. This has turned into a pretty unique data analysis, which I thought might be interesting to you guys :)

TLDR: My work does have a slightly negative influence on my happiness, but the sacrifice is not that big. I think I'm paid pretty nicely for that relatively small sacrifice, which is why I feel pretty happy about my work.

I hope this kind of analysis inspires you to think about your job as well. Do you like it? What parts do you like? What parts don't you like? Is there anything you can do in your power to prevent these negative situations? Do you feel your salary justifies your possible sacrifice in happiness? I would love to spark a discussion on this topic.

If you have any questions on the data or anything else, let me know!

Woah, that was so interesting. 

Spent my lunch break reading through all that. 

I might start rating my happiness and see if I can find any trends.

I used conditional formatting which prompted me to follow up with people given time elapsed since last contact. 

I’d be interested in an intuitive tool though. 

I’d be very interested in something like this. 

Can you give some examples about what kind of data you were tracking? :)

Did you ever track details about the interaction or the person? From my perspective, following up (or ""staying in touch"") is important but so are notes (""talking points"") about each person. Is that valuable to you?

[Here's an example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/g7IbIcO.jpg). This should give you an idea of the sort of thing I was interested in maintaining. Conversation topics primarily!

In this example I kept some specific details about ""John Smith"" (name is obscured). Normally I wouldn't remember all of these specific things (especially after two years), but the next time I do seem him I could refer to the notes and bring some of these items up. It's a means of gaining trust and better conversations!

Add to that, if I was properly using my app -- I wouldn't go 2 years without contact. I really should reach out to him just for a brief chat so the connection isn't lost.

Are there any data points or metrics you would have interest in?

Probably not, not for my networking anyway as I can see talking notes etc based on a LinkedIn conversation history. Though it would be highly valuable with dating / pick-up.

I find this weird. Some music is challenging sure, but why would you try to convince yourself to like something by repeated exposure? Isn't there enough mediocre stuff out there (Sturgeon's law) that we don't need to spend time on it?

Maybe this makes sense for a musical education or ear training. If you're trying to get through a recommended list or historically important selections. It's not particularly newsworthy that becoming more familiar with something allows you to appreciate it more.

As a DJ, I do the complete opposite while digging for music. It has to clear levels of 'crates' where each rank gets more stringent and selective. The first one is basically 'good enough to listen to again', and then on second listen, if I still like it, then it goes into a themed crate by genre/style/mood/event. Time passes, and if upon new listens it's still interesting/enjoyable/memorable/good, then it moves closer to the purchase crate. If people are paying me for my taste, then they don't deserve filler.

It is a little odd, but I could see it as a useful hack against getting stuck in a few genres. You know how people say that you get ossified in the musical preferences of whatever was on the radio when you were a teenager? Maybe you could use spaced repetition techniques to force yourself out of a rut and into new genres. Short-term pain, long-term gain. (Not quite 'musical education'.)

One thing I sometimes think about is whether you could optimize media consumption along spaced repetition lines but for maximal unfamiliarity: imagine taking the 'forgetting curve' and scheduling things to optimize for probability of having been *forgotten*. Call it [""anti-spaced repetition""](http://www.gwern.net/Statistical-notes#program-for-non-spaced-repetition-review-of-past-written-materials-for-serendipity-rediscovery-archive-revisiter). So it would try to find the music file which you are most likely to have forgotten, based on the history of past exposures. (I've also mused about this in the [context of watching new movies vs rewatching old favorite movies](https://www.gwern.net/Media-RL).)

I don't think it's about convincing oneself to like something, but rather recognizing that one listen might not be enough to determine if you like something (in part because of how the brain works).

The study will be running from 17th July to 31st of July. Participants are asked to use the app and regularly track their activities and feelings. This helps us to improve the stress detection algorithms.

For more information please visit: [http://stila.pms.ifi.lmu.de/news.html](http://stila.pms.ifi.lmu.de/news.html) . I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have here on reddit.

Thank you for your help!This might not be helpful currently, but if you ever look into Garmin wearables, let me know!

I wear a Samsubg Gear2 but have a fitbit also which I can wear on my other arm.

Also can provide other tracking data if you want it.

For example, if I want to have the habit of bringing an umbrella whenever it rains, how do I track that?  In the apps I've tried the only real option is pretending it's a daily habit and then saying I did it successfully even on days it doesn't apply (it didn't rain so I didn't need to bring an umbrella).  But that is a terrible solution because then when you look at completion percentages it doesn't reflect reality at all.

So I'm just wondering if anyone has suggestions for a clever way to track these sort of event-based habits?  Obviously I can do this in excel or on paper, but that can be difficult to keep up with over the longterm in my experience.Is having an umbrella when it rains a habit? I carry a backpack to and from work and just always keep a collapsible umbrella in it so I don't have to think about it.

You need to allow for three values, true, false and none.

By default it's obviously none

When raining if you take your umbrella it's true

When raining if you don't take your umbrella it's false

You can then compute Σ true / Σ false and this will give you a realistic ratio of your habit.

For the umbrella example, it might be better to generalize the behavior into a daily one, such as “Prep for the weather” or something.

Your daily habit could be to bring an umbrella when it might rain **and** to not bring an umbrella when there is no chance of rain. You fail to meet your goal when you forget the umbrella on a rainy day, or if you forget to remove the umbrella from your pack and carry it around on a sunny day.

I don't know if there's a good app tracker for that. What you'd need is essentially a pass/fail option that doesn't do anything if neither option is picked. Something that would show green on a calendar if passed, red if failed, and neutral if nothing is selected. 

I don't actually track that, I was just using it as an example of an event-based habit.  In that example the habit would be something like ""knowing rain was forecasted did I pack an umbrella.""

More realistically, something that I actually track, would be ""on days that I put my son to sleep and my wife is also working did I read for 30 minutes after putting him to sleep.""  In this example, my wife sporadically works in the evening, so it's only rarely that I put my son to sleep alone.  On those nights, I want to read for 30 minutes afterwards.  But since it's sporadic it doesn't really fit into the existing habit tracking apps (that I've tried).

Do you know of any apps which allow for three values?  I could run my own spreadsheet but that can become cumbersome, and all of the tracking apps I know only allow for two values.

That's a tough one. I don't know of any habit trackers that allow event-based rather than time-based tracking. Might be worth trying to write down a checklist of qualifying events that you review nightly to see if the cue happened, and whether or not you responded.

My intention is to test blood parameters for general health and fitness information, inflammation, blood fats, but also Vitamin D, etc. - basically anything one can test for to do a check as broad as possible.  

(I am based in Europe - I often hear in US podcasts that they ""get their blood tested"", but EU doctors don't seem to be used to do general tests for health and fitness - they only want to test specific parameters to diagnose disease, so I need to be specific...) For general health, I get pretty far with just chemistry/CBC/lipids (this is usually ""standard"" basic bloodwork in the US at least) and hsCRP as a clue of inflammation. If you want to see some of the actionable info you can from the chemistry/CBC values, [Michael Lustgarten](https://michaellustgarten.com/) writes a lot about them. 

From there I find it useful to keep an eye on nutritional status. But the nutrition testing can get really expensive if you try to be comprehensive, so I try to figure out plausible deficiencies and only test those. I've found [Chris Masterjohn's podcast and book](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/2017/01/26/makes-good-marker-nutritional-status/#episodes) helpful for that. 

And I personally get occasional thyroid tests because I think it's under-monitored, but that's much less common if you don't have any related symptoms. 

One resource you might want to look at is the company WellnessFX (on-demand blood tests in the US).

They have various packages of blood tests, which might be useful for identifying what specifically you could test for. https://www.wellnessfx.com/packages

What about things like prayer? Or fasting? Or doors slammed in your face on a Saturday morning? (Just kidding, Mormons and JWs!)Hi I'm a Christian. I probably don't speak for all Christians here, but I like to keep track a couple of things: 

- The books of the Bible I've read, as well as the date of completion of each book so that if I want to read through another book I can find the least recent one to refresh. I also note number of chapters in each (so that in the future I'll know if it's a quick read or not), and some main ideas. 

- My prayers, the time I sent that prayer, the details of that prayer, and I note if they're answered as well as the date and time answered and the way it was answered.

There's also some other things I keep track of but long story short, yes, I like the quantecize certain aspects of my faith as it helps me see my development as a Christian and catalog my relationship with God so I don't forget things.

To people who say ""You're missing the point"", I say everyone's walk with God is different. So some of us are just ""go with the flow"" types, but people like me we like organization and it helps us track our progress in our walk with God.

I guess not.

I'm a Christian, as well, and I track whatever I can at this point. That includes which books of the Bible I've gone through, the date started/finished, current progress (I don't always do one book at a time), current progress in different reading plans, skipped days, the amount of time per day/week/etc. I also record what I'm doing every second of the day (more or less) with aTimeLogger. I have a goal of 7 hours per week of religious activities to hit my 'Jesus goal'. While some people say it misses the point, I know that if I am not spending at least an hour a day, I'm probably not making any time for God during the week, especially because meetings and church itself accounts for at least 3 hours per week. 

I do use Last.FM as well, which inadvertently tracks my worship time, I guess, but it also tracks my overnight music playing from a playlist which has vastly distorted my most-listened-to artists. 

I should probably start tracking fasts, though. I do intermittent fasting daily, and it'd be nice to know which days I succeed and which days I fail, but I also do religious fasts, and it'd be nice to quantify that. I'll probably throw something together so I can start doing that. 

Awesome, thanks for the reply! So for the Bible books, you mainly use your data to inform the next book you read? What do you do with the prayer data?

I agree about liking organization. Some people are just naturally motivated, but tracking things is actually motivating for me.

My pleasure! 

The Bible data basically optimizes which book I should read next. The dates and times help me choose according to how long it's been since I've read a book or if I've read the book at all. The main ideas are there to help me choose a book that's relevant to my life at the moment so I can get more out of reading. So those notes help me choose accordingly, instead of just flipping to somewhere random and hoping it'll help (might work for others but I like practicality, haha).

The prayer notes are primarily there to document my encounters with God. Practicality-wise it prevents me from forgetting lessons I've learned. But just as you said, keeping track of things is motivating! I can look back and see ""oh yeah at this time I was going through X Y and Z, and I prayed such and such, and God responded with such and such and I changed in this manner, and I learned this and that. I'll keep this lesson in mind and keep growing!"". 
But it's also like a book of my walk with God. Sort of like if you looked through a photo album of you since you were little and you can see how you've grown and developed through the years. You see all the naivety and youth at the beginning, young and not knowing any better. You see all the awkward years, filled with emotion and lack of self esteem. And you see the years when things finally started to make sense, when you became a mature adult. And through all of this, in every picture your father was right there at your side, proud of you as he's seen you grow, filled with love for you.

I am currently also tracking \(or trying to track\) the following data:

* If you do any kind of physical activity, there is most likely a dedicated app for it. Many even have a documented API. Many apps also support linking data with Google Fit. From Google Fit you can scrape all your fitness data at once. Google Fit also supports things like numbers of steps taken.
* You could also track your location and log how much time you spent where. Google does not let you read out your location history. However there are a number of third party apps that support that.
* Tracking your sleep: I have mixed experiences with tracking my sleep. There are many different apps for tracking the sleep. Most of them require you to tell the app when you go to bed each time and you have to lay your smartphone on the matress if you want data on sleep quality. Apps that try to automatically track your sleeping hours are always way off.
* For more sophisticated passive tracking you have to build your own solutions. I am currently working on recognising when I am playing guitar using a Raspberry Pi and a microphone. There is a really neat library called pyAudioAnalysis for audio classification. There are many other things you can passivly track using different sensors like how long you are sitting on your desk each day.

If you have an android phone, Tasker is amazing. I have my sleep/wake times, when I'm using certain groups of apps, when my phone's screen is on, and my location.

As an aside, did you build that site? I'm thinking about making one myself with heroku to do the exact same thing. Any pointers as to where to go to get started?

Awesome dashboard and setup. Might have to try this. A couple of iOS apps that might work:
- Arc: tracks your location and how you got there.
- life cycle: similar to arc but more detail and gives nice graphs on your history. 

Thanks! It's open source too if you want to use it for yourself - https://github.com/Andreilys/personal_dashboard

Yeah I'd love to be able to track my physical activity, but unfortunately I have an iPhone and the walled garden makes it hard to get data... 

I actually use Moves which has a great API allowing me to see which locations I've visited. Awesome idea for the passive tracking! I actually hadn't even considered setting up my own sensors, I own a raspberry pi but honestly haven't really experimented with it too much - any resources you recommend?

You can download your entire location history from Google at once for historical purposes though. Then track with something else from now on. 

[deleted]

Sadly there a next to no resources on passive tracking and quantified self as this community is still way to small. However there are a ton of resources for IoT and smart homes and the techniques used are the same (like controlling your GPIO pins or setting up a web server for accessing your data).
One thing I would recommend is OpenCV, a light way image recognition library where you could for example detect what activity you are currently doing (eating, reading, sleeping, ...)

> entire location history

...minus the place names from your timeline; for some reason those are missing from the Takeout download...

Heart rate variability (HRV) tracker; I've used www.getlief.com.  The lief patch gives you haptic feedback when you feel anxiety; this helps to connect your triggers to a situation or a thought.  

With an HRV tracker, you can teach your nervous system not to feel anxious when you are in that situation or having that thought in the future.  

I first started with HRV with the EMwave2 from heart institute, and I was very impressed with the results.  I highly recommend it.

Easy to measure HR increases.
But I understand that more important is the beat pattern that has the most important part (eg irregular).

Cam facial detection can be good.

Really personal, but since you're a year in, how are you finding your happiness levels?

That was neat. 

Curious about what apps and processes you use to organize the data.  

I am guessing you have videos on that?

Hey! No problem. I'm actually now nearly three years in with tracking happiness. It's been Really helpful. Overall, on average, I'm generally good (roughly a 4/5). It's been really useful for helping me notice when I'm going into a slump and need to change something in my life. I feel like teaching it has made me happier, but I can't say statistically since I can't compare it with before I started tracking it.

Lastly, I've noticed that at times when I'm feeling depressed, my mood isn't generally lower, it's only slightly lower but much more chatoic, with bigger mood swings from day to day. 

Does that answer your question??? :)

Thanks! This is actually my first data video, so I haven't explained any of that yet. Here is a brief summary relevant to this video:

Collecting: Mood and diary (activities and beer) - Daylio (app) Mac and Android tracking - RescueTime Music - last.fm (connected to spotify) Fitness (heart rate, sleep, steps) - FitBit Charge 2

Organizing: All of those apps let you export data, usually at a small fee for premium memberships. I put all those CSV files together using LibreOffice. Mostly it was all one big, crazy spreadsheet. 

That is much more of an answer than I expected. Thank you so very much.

It's great to hear that you average out ~4/5.  

It's really interesting that you noticed that your depressed state is predominantly an increase in variability/volatility.  I wonder how widespread/common that is.  I guess only more data over sustained periods from wider groups can answer that.

It's an interesting world we're moving into, where big data concepts can be applied to a quantified self on micro and macro scales to generate enlightening epiphanies, often incredibly hard to see any other way.

How did you count the number of beers you used with Daylio? I’ve been trying to do the same things but can’t see how the app allows that. Thanks! 

No problemo! I've wondered the same things... And I'm really interested to see what happens with all of the data protection are gathering. Might help open up a whole new field of research!

Have a great day!

I too really wish it let you include numbers like that. Basically I have one activity titled Beer and another titled Multibeers, and if I do have Multibeers I type in how many in the journal section. Far from ideal, but since I don't drink a lot it's okay.

I was wondering if more of you are also tracking happiness, or a version of it (like joy, fulfillment etc).

If so, I would love to start a discussion of what tracking happiness means to you. What is your opinion about tracking happiness, as opposed to tracking other things about yourself?I track contentment, stress and productivity \(1 to 10\) and they are not excluding each other. I also track whether I spend the most of the day at work, home or away \(which includes general activities as well as holidays\). In general, I aim for higher contentment and productivity and lower stress level over time. The data so far is not very informative.. except that apparently stress does not have a great impact on contentment, productivity however does. Also, I tend to be most content when I am away \(and productivity is either very high or very low\). I will try to do a more in\-depth analysis at the end of the year. 

I started this, but couldn't continue with it. Measuring happiness if so subjective. At first, I used to track how I am spending my daily hours. I used to score (out of 10) any particular activity based on how happy or unhappy I was. I had a few buckets. I followed this scoring for a few months, but then I lost interest in this setup.

Then I thought of something else. Instead of scoring, I started writing a 1-3 sentence summary of how my day went. Then I flagged it happy/unhappy and also added a reason for the happiness/unhappiness. Sadly, I also abandoned it.

So, now I have stopped doing it. :p




Have an app on my phone ""Mind Jogger"" that prompts me six times a day at random times where I measure my mood, energy level and focus level on a scale of 1-10. Been doing it for years. My mood is remarkably stable. Focus and energy vary.

Some relevant talks and blog posts: http://quantifiedself.com/happiness/

Daylio.
It is epic.

That sounds like a lot of interesting data. How long have you been going so far? Do you track this information every single day?

That's awesome. Makes me wonder, was there anything you learned from your data? 

Your second method sounds like a good combination, sort of like a happiness journal. That's how I would describe what I do as well.

Great idea for an app. You must have some very cool data if you've been doing this for years! :) What is your ultimate goal with this data?  Or do you want to just track and measure it to see how you can improve stuff?

I've only been tracking since the beginning of the year so there is not that much data yet. But yes, I do track it every single day. 
I made it easy to track as well. Its in google sheets and I made it so that it opens automatically every time I open my browser, so I never really forget about it. 

I have several goals re: QS data collection
1) Track data to lose weight and increase strength (achieved but a never ending battle)
2) Establish a baseline personal to me instead of a cohort (49yo white male) 
3) Find anomalies and abnormalities from my baseline early and intervene
4) Find correlations and attempt interventions for specific reasons

I have been using the device to help myself recognise tilt and negative emotions and which coping mechanism works. 

Postgame this is what my data looks like (https://imgur.com/a/4sANVdn). 
The yellow line is my BPM. I know what I'm doing during the early game so my heart rate is very consistent except for when I had my first death. I started performing some breathing exercises to help bring it back down again. 

The midgame and late game were very taxing, my heart rate would jump between 68-150. I tried using keywords and breathing exercises but by the late game I had forgotten and was totally tilted hence higher amount of deaths at the end. 

The green line is a function of HRV to try and model stress. It interesting to note that at ~27 mins they hit Baron and I knew the game was over and my HRV went under the bar(-negative is less stressed). 

Have anyone else measured their HR and made useful changes from the data? 

Any useful advice? 


**At 26 mins, I got tilted and threw my headphones which knocked the sensor hence why it skyrocketed to 220BPM. 

So as I understand it, tilt = anger/frustration, right?
What's the formula/model for tilt you have? And does it take into account APM?

That first big bump at ~13 min in is what you should be trying to detect because it's the first place where the tilt is visible in the data.

I've been using the Moves app to collect my location data since 2013. It's been a good way for me to see my activity and, more importantly, where I have been over the years.

I linked the app with an app called Move-o-Scope that aggregates all of this data and shows it to you on a map - like so: https://imgur.com/a/GEZa3Da

Unfortunately, the service stopped working a while back (not sure why) and has not been updating for the past few months. 

This was a great tool for me to see my life map. Luckily, Moves have allowed users to export all data from the app but I have pretty much zero idea how to use it and would appreciate any help in getting this data in a format that looks like the Move-o-Scope. I've been messing about with TileMill but it's a little too complex for me and I'm not getting very far. I've managed to get my data imported (finally!) but I can't get it to look anywhere near as good as it did on Move-o-Scope and it certainly isn't interactive (i.e. looking at certain times, different activities, heatmap of places visited, etc.)

If anyone has any insight, I'd be really appreciative!I've had the same problem, and after a sleepless night a while back I managed to build my own solution (https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/vanillachief/cjg00v3c75eez2rn4cd081mm6.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoidmFuaWxsYWNoaWVmIiwiYSI6ImNqZTZpemZtNzAwMHYzM3RkZTl3YmFuNzEifQ.tPhjkwxv23EPw5V6v7ngIw#8.68/48.6345/8.7757). I try to write down my process to the best of my recollection and hope you gain some inspiration

1. Save your data as .gpx files on your computer (from your post I see you've managed to do this already)
2. I use a program called QGIS, which is open source, free and available for Mac, Windows, Linux, BSD and Android (I use the Mac version) (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
3. In QGIS I created a new project and imported all my single .gpx files. This is a tedious process, since I needed to select the ""track"" data for each file individually. There may be a better way, but I did not find it.
4. I Installed the plugin mmqgis. It's a set of tools for layer editing. Plugin Installation is very simple in QGIS. Just open the extension manager and search for the plugin
5. In mmqgis menu, which will appear after the plugin is installed. Select combine>Merge layers and merge all the single .gpx layers and save it as a new shape file.
6. right click the new layer and save as>GPX (select GPX_USE_EXTENSION: NO down in the settings. Don't know why anymore, but something didn't work if not)
7. now you have a single gpx-file with all your data
8. created an account on mapbox.com
9. Used a freely available map-style to start out
10. Add new layer>select source tileset>create new tileset>upload your .gpx files. (Mapbox allows gpx-file upload up to 260mb. So if you have more in a single file. Merge your layers in QGIS maybe into a couple different layers. Maybe one for each year.)
11. Now you should see your tracks on the map
12. play a little around with your design
13. publish

I hope this helps you. If you have any questions, I will try to help :)
 

Google Fusion Tables is quite good at visualizing tracklogs, see [this example](https://eric.jain.name/2010/12/12/one-years-tracklogs/).
That data wasn't recorded with Moves, but you could use the same approach if you figure out how to export your data to GPX (maybe using [this service](http://www.moves-export.com/)?).

Can you drop me your email on DM? Here at Aidlab \([aidlab.com](https://aidlab.com)\) we are building an app which is very similar to Moves, and soon we are going to release our first beta. Would love to invite you for open beta.

That’s awesome mate I’ll try t out after work tonight and see how far I get. 

Your map looks awesome! Do you know if there’s a way to add the places data too as a heat map? 

Google Fusion Tables was my first choice too, but there wasn't enough customisation options in the service so I decided to move on. It was a good way to actually learn what data was in each file from the Moves export service though!

Use onenote to jot down notes while reading, then at the end of the year you have both a nice list and a bunch of notes to refresh your memory.

Any suggestions? What do you use?I purchased the Heartmath Emwave2, and I love it.  It sells for $200; I bought it from eBay for $100.  It's pretty convenient because of the ear clip and finger sensor, and you can use it without any app.   There is no app, but the online dashboard is useful though.  It is not designed for all day use, just for HRV training and balancing out your mood.

I also bout the Lief from Lief Therapeutics, Getlief.com, and only used it a couple of times. It is a wearable that sticks under your chest and tracks your HRV all day long.  When it senses your stressed it will vibrate to notify you; then it will vibrate in a pattern to breathe in and out to relax.  It's a pretty cool device but costly at $280.

I also pre-ordered the Oura ring, this to will track your hrv all day long.  I don't have any experience with it, but I'm excited to see something called the readiness score.  This score will tell you when your system has recovered from exertion.  I am 35 years old and play basketball; my body doesn't heal like it used to.  I'll be using this recovery score to know when I can go back on the court.



Several Garmin devices use HRV tracking throughout the day and report it as ""Stress,"" which gets normalized to an arbitrary 1-100 scale. You can also do a dedicated three minute HRV test, too, but that requires a heart rate strap for extra accuracy. 


I use a Garmin Forerunner 645 because it is a specialized GPS watch for runners, but they make cheaper activity/fitness trackers that look at the same HRV data if that's all you're interested in. 

My Zoom HRV stopped working and I haven't tried resetting it yet, but while it was working I loved it.

By ""throughout the day"", do you mean continuously, or would several manual measurements qualify?

For me personally, I am most excited about recording every second of every day because my memory is really bad. Life logging comforts me knowing that everything I have ever done is stored somewhere.

Other data like health stats seem like they are helpful to provide me actionable data to improve my sleep and physical well-being.

I guess, my thinking is that we only live once, so every second that goes by is another second gone. All of these seconds of our lives, we generate data. It seems like a shame to let all of our information disappear as if we never existed—especially now that we have the technological capability to collect and store all of it!Understand what makes me Happy


I want to start tracking my time as an attempt to gather the discipline to use it better and waste less.

Any tips on good tools and categories to track? 

I also like to track some things as a kind of extended memory, especially if they don't require much effort. It's nice being able to easily answer questions like ""have I seen this movie"", ""have I been less active this winter than last winter"", or ""when did I least at at this restaurant"". But tracking that's more involved I do only for specific experiments, for weeks or months at most.

[deleted]

Agreed, seems like those are the two pain points of using this method right now 

I collect data relevant to my goals to bring awareness to ways I can improve. I found by defining the metric of improvement -for example miles I run- I am less likely to feel defeated by physical pain or mental challenge because I can externalize my results and see how they bring me closer to my goals. 

are you just using a manual emotion log? If so which one?

It sounds like you basically want to track how you spend your time. Is that accurate? If so, you should check out:
• [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/)
• [Moment](https://inthemoment.io/)

Have you ever considered life logging with a video camera? You know like recording everything all the time in video?

That's a lot of different things. I assume steps and sleep patterns are tracked with apps of some kind. How do you track mood, diet, and self care? and then how do you compare the data in order to glean correlations?

I'm Just logging a number from 1 to 5 representing my happiness. I also log some text if something relevant has happened.
Pretty simple, maybe I should improve this system, but it's a starting point :)

I'd consider that if wearing a camera were less awkward, and if I could query the video stream at a high level (when did I last meet person x, how much time do I spend eating lunch etc).

awesome! that seems like a pretty manageable approach. Are you able to see correlations between certain behaviors and happiness? and how long have you been logging these numbers?

Yea those seem to be the main pain points of using this approach right now. So do you just manually keep track of those things in a diary like format?

Haven't analized them yet

Every feedback is appreciated, especially the ""first impression"" kind of things :)

It looks promising!
I also like the front page design, the tooltips and the easy to grasp correlation graph.
Beside telling about the business model and rights i would suggest to create an about page with the creator(s) and the story/motivation behind the stuff (this create more connection and trust with your future users).
However my biggest question is why this will be easier/faster to use than let's say a google calendar that's feeds into a spreadsheet with one click? I think most QS users are already using that combo.

I have been using the app since 2 weeks. The things that I track currently are:

- My mood

- My stress level

- My work hours

- Sleeping hours

- Work performance

- Personal success

- Personal failures

- Type of food I eat

- Weight

- Physical Exercises

- Data about the app itself (amount of users)

The most important thing that I learned and that is already helping a lot is that my stress level is directly linked to the amount of hours I work in a day. 

Before using the app, I thought that working less would help me relax... I actually discovered that it was the opposite: more work hours equals less stress. I investigated it a bit and I realized that when I work a lot, I don't have time to think about what could go wrong. I also tend to think that if I put a lot of work in, things can't go wrong - which is reassuring :)

Looks interesting, I like the front page design and the intro tooltips are great. The rendering on mobile needs to be improved, the page didn't resize (non fluid?) on my device (chrome on OnePlus 5) so I had to scroll around to follow the tooltips. 
Questions:
Is the intent that users will be able to add their own event types? 
What's your plan for prompting users to remind them to do their desired habit activity?
Commercial model: is this going to be freemium, ad based or are you trying to grow users and get bought out?

Edit: I see now you have a mobile option at the top, but I can't click on that until I've clicked through all the tips. Perhaps it should automatically switch to the mobile page for mobile devices.

I think the about page is a great idea. I will add one :).

I actually already run a quite successful blog talking about my first steps as an indie developer, if you are interested: http://mystartupfails.notecompanion.com/

The reason why this is easier/faster is that you basically only need one click to update your information for the day. Also, the interface is way more comfortable than a google spreadsheet. A lot of additional features will also be added, which will bring more than a simple spreadsheet (unless you are an excel programmer)

Above functionality, what I want to offer is usability - which is something I wouldn't underestimate.


Hey, thanks for the feedback :)

I am planning to release a full mobile app for this project. That's the reason why I didn't take the time to make the web version mobile friendly. However, the feedback about not being able to use the page properly on mobile comes back quite often, so I might have to do something about...

> Is the intent that users will be able to add their own event types?

Not sure what you mean by event type, but users are able to create their own custom stats. So you can even track stuff like how often you do the cartwheel a day :)

> What's your plan for prompting users to remind them to do their desired habit activity?

Just a clarification, the app is meant to keep track of data about yourself - not to tell you what to do. I actually don't like such apps: I tend to uninstall them because I don't like to be pressured into doing things :D. 

Here, it's about getting information to make informed decisions.

I am however thinking about sending a mail reminder for people to check in their data for the day on the website. The mobile version will have notifications and a very simple ""swipe"" tool to update your info.

> Commercial model: is this going to be freemium, ad-based or are you trying to grow users and get bought out?

The web version is meant to be completely free. I am counting on the mobile version to generate incomes. The mobile version will offer more features and be more convenient thanks to the portability. I am planning to have a freemium model: basic features for free, advanced features for premium users.

I just posted about it, but if you interested I have just created this tool: https://app.getdailys.com/

You can track absolutely anything you want as you can create custom stats. It will generate graphs for you and show you the correlations between everything you track :)

I use Workflow on iOS to write an entry into a Dropbox txt file for various occasions. 

For example, i log my location occasionally for my work, or log my car mileage this way. Very convenient, straight from the Notification Center. 

I have an Excel file that pulls in all this data automatically whenever I open it, so I can make sense out of it.  

I caved and built what I needed for myself: https://medium.com/@tastyc0de/3-steps-to-quantify-your-habits-791cdcff59af

Couldn’t get any more basic, but I love the ‘Way of Life’ app. Costs like 3 seconds a day to note stuff down. Definitely check out the free version 

I use Asana for personal task & project management, and you can definitely sort by date completed and look at graphs of task creation vs. task completion in a given project over time. [This blog post](https://asana.com/guide/help/projects/progress) from their site has good examples of those graphs toward the bottom. Asana's also good for keeping it simple - you can employ multiple projects or none at all (tasks do not have to be assigned to a project or to an assignee), so it sounds like a simple solution to what you're looking for.

If you just want to log events happening, there are quite a few options (Nomie et al). Do you want to include one or more variables, and do you care what time you completed each tasks (or are you tracking at the day level)?

What I want to know is if there are any trackers that enable uploading photos

R enviroment to import, summarise and plot data

I thought I was drinking a lot when I had 4 cups in a day...

Wow, 20 cups in a day?

This is really nice, visually! Thanks for sharing

Any advice on getting started using R to import/summarize/plot data? Tempted to learn to use something other than Tableau.

Can you aggregate coffee consumption by time of day and compare over time? Curious if you're just drinking smaller amounts of coffee throughout the day, or if the difference is due to cutting back coffee consumption during certain hours...

What kind of chart is this called? I know it's similar to what Github uses to visualize commits. 

I usually drink mugs (and count roughly a mug as 4 cups). Anyhow, 5 MUGS of coffee in a day were a wake-up call. This was near the end of  my Master's Thesis.

[deleted]

I started using R for work. If you want to start using R just as as a hobby, you may have  a problem because the learning curve to coding (any language, not just R) is a bit steep. I suggest looking up [R for Beginners](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf), which explains in the first chapters how to import, manage and plot data.

Then you have to check out some online tutorial about the 'dplyr' and 'ggplot2' packages, which make summarising and plotting data so much easier.

Good luck!

Not really, because I have the bad habit of not recording events right away. However, the strategy I used was changing to a smaller mug (a half-mug, actually), and switching to tea at night (yes, I used to drink coffee at 10 pm). So it is a little bit of both

Google Charts calls it a calendar plot.

However, it is nothing more than a heatmap with days of the week and week of the month as coordinates, and subsetted by Month and Year.

I'm curious about the actual size of your mug. 

I use this as a way to try to cut down. It's encouraging to see that I'm managing to do it (with some clear relapses :P)

Useful, thanks Kenup!

- how much am I spending on booze, or other categories that are more luxuries than essentials. 

One challenge I foresee is that the receipts often use abbreviations which can be hard for humans to understand... I’m guessing the app may also have difficulty parsing those. 

What information are you extracting from the receipts? Just the individual products, or also their categories (like veggies, meat, and cleaning supplies)?

Most of the interesting things to do with that information would be to correlate it with data from other sources, like body weight or physical activity.

I'm sure most of you know/remember Seth Roberts. His theory of flavorless calories reducing hunger is still frustratingly untested (despite Eliezer Yudkowsky's admonition for scientists to ""get off their ass and test this thing already"") so I figured I would organize a group test of it. I'll let the late great Aaron Swartz summarize the theory here:

>“Your body stores up calories when food is abundant so it can use them in ‘lean years’, when food is scarce. So it would make sense for a person to be more hungry when food is abundant (allowing them to build up fat) and less hungry when it’s scarce (so they don’t feel hungry all the time).

>“The problem, of course, is that food is never scarce anymore. You can always just go to McDonald’s. The body is storing up for an eventuality that will never come. So how do you get it to stop? Maybe you could trick it into thinking food was scarce. This is where Roberts’s big insight comes —if we eat foods with little taste, our brain assumes we’re eating them because there’s nothing else around… A couple hundred calories of flavorless olive oil is the preferred suggestion.”

Rather than test weight loss (which is highly variable) we're studying the mechanism of hunger. There are more details about the design in the faq. Anyway, here's a link to the sign-up (which also links the faq and an explainer of Seth's theory): [plankify.com/satbasic](http://www.plankify.com/satbasic)

Please feel free to respond or DM me with any questions! Thanks everyone.Signed up!

A few first impressions going into the experiment:

* seems like it would be an unbalanced 200-500 calories of fat into my diet. I'm on a 1000 cal keto/IF diet with 67g of fat. Trying to consume a blend of monounsaturated fat (like ELOO), polyunsaturated fat (for the omega3s/6s) and saturated fat (MCTs for weight training). I wish this was a cocktail of oils instead of just one type. 

* pore clogging is a concern

* swallowing just oil seems unpleasant. Anticipating that it'll coat or cling to my throat

Not looking forward doing to this, but interested in seeing what the results are. gl

That's great, thanks! 

Just to respond a bit to your thoughtful suggestions:
We are recommending 2 Tbsp (so roughly 200-250 calories) and I can definitely imagine how that might imbalance macros. If this theory works it would definitely be useful to test out what other flavorless oils and foods are feasible Though of course for now it's better to keep the protocol the same for comparisons sake.

Anyway, thank you for participating despite your concerns. There will be an opportunity for you to note any other observations you had during the week (like clogged pores), so please let us know!

Regression is very interesting, but it doesn't differentiate between correlation and causation. I'm not planning to make any major decisions based on the results here, I'm more interested in which habits co-vary as well as how they change over time. I've only included things I do at least once a week.

List of explanatory variables:

- Fap
- Cardio	
- weights	
- anti-oxidants	
- cook	
- work	
- class	
- social	(seeing and talking to someone I have a longstanding relationship with)
- caloric deficit	
- bball	
- laundry	
- coffee
- study	
- shop	
- groom	
- alcohol	
- gluten	
- salmon	
- dairy	
- cocoa	
- weekend	
- apply jobs

List of outcomes:

 - Happiness
 - Anxiety

For tracking the variable will be a 1 for I did it that day a 0 for I didnt. Then a regression will explain the ""importance"" of each variable on the outcomes.

One interesting thing about regression is that explanatory variables can depend on and affect each other, for instance ""alcohol"" will usually be accompanied by ""social"" therefore its not entirely possible to disentangle their effects, so everything must be taken with a grain of salt.

Any other things that are important I could track? Any outcomes worth recording? I only have if I'm happy that day or if I'm anxious. I'd love to have more possibilities

EDIT: as non-binary variables I will also track phone usage time and computer usage time, as those values are easily gathered.It's not a habit, but you might want to track the length of the day and how much sunshine there was on that day. That can affect your mood.

I think hours of sleep is the biggest thing you’re missing here.

Instead of trying to track all these things for ten years (because that's about how long it will take to collect enough data to see anything that's statistically significant), consider experimenting with one thing at a time. 

The sophisticated neural network in your head probably already has some suspicions as to what makes you happy or anxious, so start with experiments around those variables...

This is great! :)

I've never looked into regression analysis, thanks for the tip!

I'm using a lot of Project management principles (Progress Management Systems and the sort), look it up, I think it'll help you as well.

Also, as user [u/lotteryroll](https://www.reddit.com/user/lotteryroll) stated, you really need to track sleep.

bowel movements :P

I did something very similar to what you're trying to do. What I found really changed my life. Instead of finding that a list of variables changed my happiness scale, what made me happier was my desire to be happy.

As I logged my happiness on a scale, at some point I said, ""fuck this, I'm going to be happier."" From that, everything else changed.

I recommend you add to your variable list: physical/affectionate contact with a human, entertainment (TV, video games, internet), sleep, accomplishments (test scores, projects completed, winks from girls). Also if you keep an outlook or google calendar, it's not too difficult to pull that data in as well.

To your outcome list, I would be sure happiness/anxiety had a scale. Also, I found a lot of use out of qualitative notes for each day. I've broken mine into three categories: Regrets, Blessings, Goals.

Best of luck!

Good call. It's a bitch to measure without a fitbit though. I might throw in a 1-0 slept well, didn't; more than 7 less than 7 thing. 

First of all, More like 90 days not ten years. (let's both try to come. Up with some data on our claims.) 

I agree we have some foreknowledge about what we think is useful. We should both test those to see if they're significant, and test some things we don't think are significant to see if we'll discover something new, although this is a little ""hunting around in the dark"" 

How are you tracking all of this?

Do you use an app or excel spreadsheet?

OK, maybe not ten years :-) But the point remains: If you want to be able to uncover subtle, non-obvious correlations, the more factors are in play, the more data you'll need.

I think all these people are robots. There's no way you can track this much information at this level of sophistication without finding yourself starting to log data that relates to the data you're logging in the first place.

Along the lines of ""I spent 6 hours logging data today, and I increased my data logging efficiency by 25% this week"". It all starts to become less about your life and more about logging data.

True. I realize data collection is a huge cost. I want to look into unlocking my phone as a data collection unit. (google probably already does this, give me my data google!) 

Is your phone moving rapidly? Record that as an hour of driving. Is it hearing lots of distinct voices? Record that as social time or movie watching. And if this can be put into a spreadsheet and analyzed automatically it's a huge time saver.

Maybe just grab some highlighters from the dollar store so I can find each topic more easily, maybe something more complicated.

My current approach:

* Mini composition book, black ballpoint pen, kept in pocket or next to bed.
* Jot down every item as soon as possible after the event.
* Date on very left every time it changes, time (usually nearest half hour) one column over, actual items everything to the right of that. Horizontal line to separate each full night's sleep.
* Keeping track of: sleep/wake times, medications, vitamins and supplements, food (not calorie counting, just what and when), weight, exercise, anything unexpected but medically relevant, a couple of small daily things that I've noticed are proxies for my mood.

(I started on Nov 6, about 90 days ago, and have filled 60 pages out of the mini-book's 100.)

Anyone have any suggestions?
I'm a big advocate for spreadsheets, however, my advice is to start with the easiest method first.

To anyone who's still here: Half-a-dozen highlighter colours are more than worth the bother. I can now actually flip through the pages following individual topics, without having to squint through every single line to find (or miss) the one line mentioning whatever I'm looking for.

(If you're curious: yellow for food & drink, blue for sleep/wake, orange for meds/supplements, pink for exercise, purple for weight, green for mood, un-highlighted for misc notes.)

The one rule I set for myself, which lets me write down /everything/ potentially medically relevant, is that the only people I plan on ever showing this journal to are myself and my doctor(s).

It's 2018. Is there no well-designed app that is able to serve as a unified hub for my tracking? Things, for instance, I think it should be able to do:

* detailed food tracking, or at least integration with the major food tracking apps (access to food databases is critical to the usefulness of MyFitnessPal, Loseit, etc., so I don't necessarily expect a non-specialized app to have all of that built in)
* built-in weather integration by location
* actually, basically any data you can gather by location should be possible to track automatically
* self-logging of any custom metric using a variety of data forms (e.g., should be able to enter data by selection from a list, sliding of a slider, numerical entry, text box, etc)
* integration with device apps and auto-logging apps like RescueTime
* actually, integration with as many other apps as possible
* data visualization
* a clean interface, hopefully


Does there exist anything remotely like this yet? 
Nomie has an API which you can push any data to. I use it to log my completed Todoist tasks for instance. However, for nondevelopers this is difficult to setup.

How about Exist? https://exist.io It has a lot of apps integrated into it as well as custom tracking. However, the custom tracking is still fairly limited but they’re working on it!

Gyroscope does a nice job of amalgamation and presentation. 

There are several services that can aggregate data from may sources... Zenobase is one of the more flexible ones: You can manually enter structured data or import from general-purpose tracking apps apps like Nomie, geotag existing data using location data from Google or Moves, have weather data added, etc. However, food tracking is rudimentary (we never managed to get access to MyFitnesspal's API), and it's not a mobile app.

Gyroscope(http://gyrosco.pe/) is the best i have found so far.

Moodimodo is excellent for setting up your own experience sampling and lets you connect with APIs, including weather, myfitnesspal, and fitbit.

You can set up the time you want triggers to log and it is supported as a chrome browser extension and on mobile.

I have it set up to integrate mood tracking, weather, medications, and rescuetime. It automatically does correlations between data streams for you and visualizes these.

I'm looking for something fully customizable in which I could add:

1) abstract data (Which I can handle the collection and processing of)

2) new visualizations and aggregators (Which I can build and add to an existing platform)

I'm a somewhat competent programmer so I'm willing to do a lot of the leg work required in connecting all my data sources, transforming data as needed, and adding new visualization and aggregation elements when what I'm looking for doesn't exist. Essentially, I'd like to not start from square one and hopefully find a community of people working on similar projects and goals. In a few google searches, I found [Flow Dashboard](https://github.com/onejgordon/flow-dashboard) and [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com). 

Has anyone had any experience or success adding quantified self data to these  or other platforms? What are there strengths and weaknesses?If you can code, you could skip past these tools (and other similar tools like tableau or spotfire) and look at something like flask or shiny (or your own js to Python/R link). That way you‘ll never run into limitations of your toolset - and you‘ve got python and r for all the data processing (plus both have packages for hitting most api‘s that hold your data), plus pre built mapping to interactive plotting tools like d3 and plotly via flask or shiny. 

learning curve isnt that bad - e.g I have no CS or coding training (I‘m an epidemiologist) and make dashboards of patient data using these tolls as part of my job. 

Hey I’m working on a tool that does something similar. Takes a couple metrics and creates a dashboard for you. 

Meports.com

Dash.Meports.com is the dashboard 

Would love your feedback 

What kind of data do you have, and what do you intend to do with it? [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) has some open source code for dealing with Quantified Self data if you want to build something from scratch. If on the other hand you're looking for an existing solution that lets you feed in additional data through an API, check out [Zenobase](https://zenobase.com/).

Now, I'm using Google spreadsheets for a quick way to sort/store/treat/show data, but it's far, very far, from Ideal. 

This may be what I have to do, I was just hoping to avoid having to tackle many of the same problems others would likely have faced. My UI skills are also pretty weak, but maybe this would be an opportunity to work on them. 

Looks really cool! This has a lot of what I want to use and definitely has the holistic birds eye view of everything + cross habit analysis I'd be looking for. The big things that matter to me that I couldn't find on the website:

1) How automated can the data collection be? Looking for something that supports both known passive tracking services and customized ones. I'm planning on having to do the work to connect up APIs and what not, but my ideal service allows custom passive input.

2) Is it open source? Inevitably there will be things I want to see that aren't packaged, and I'd love to be able to edit a build of the server and contribute things that might be useful for others.

Looks awesome! I signed up for the beta list in the mean time.

Your work immediately brought to mind Tiago Forte's article @ Ribbon Farm: 

https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/01/28/productivity-for-precious-snowflakes. 

I've taken a few quotes so you can preview the ideas in the article before diving in: 

> But access to tools, locations, and people is no longer the primary constraint in doing valuable work. Nor do “energy levels” come close to capturing the subtleties of human motivation. I believe we’re entering a new era: Mood-First Productivity. States of mind, or more colloquially, moods, are bubbling up to the surface as every external constraint on work falls away, one after the other.

---
> My point here is that I believe states of mind are not just cool trips, but concrete competitive assets. Their irreproducibility makes them a good candidate for the “stash of hoarded unfair advantages” that makes entrepreneurship hard. The more states you have access to, and the better you are at juggling them from situation to situation, the more you will be able to leverage intellectual knowledge with more-difficult-to-Google tacit knowledge.

> But access to tools, locations, and people is no longer the primary constraint in doing valuable work. Nor do “energy levels” come close to capturing the subtleties of human motivation. I believe we’re entering a new era: Mood-First Productivity. States of mind, or more colloquially, moods, are bubbling up to the surface as every external constraint on work falls away, one after the other.

---

> States of mind are a better guide to modern work than values (which don’t always motivate), goals (which often change), and processes (which try to prescribe the unprescribable) precisely because moods are the only things that change just as fast as the world around us. 

I hope the article can give you some ideas for experimentation. Some quick ideas I thought of:

- See what activities certain moods trigger
- What is the best mood for a certain activity
- Figure out ways to get into certain moods for certain tasks

I imagine this will require figuring out how to capture more advanced moods, which seems like a huge task in itself! 

 




Very well done! One suggestion: When looking at the average mood per hour of day or day of week, it would be useful to have some measure of the variance, to help judge of a difference is significant or not.

On a rare occasion I’ll read the feed, but I almost never comment, like, or share stuff anymore, let alone post anything myself. I used to be an eponymous user.

Does anyone do more than just read stuff on the feed that’s gone semi-viral? I know there was just an algorithm change, that might change things.

One of the tracking tools I have will pull in data from Facebook and Twitter out of the box, so I thought I would correlate what I like/post/engage in/share to harder data in my life, like locations, time, or heart rate, but I’ve just realized I almost never go beyond lurking.Facebook is a free ad platform that is milking you of your valuable information - to be used against you at an undetermined date in the future. 

Any “good” you get from Facebook can likely be obtained elsewhere for free with a little sleuthing. 

I quit Facebook almost 5 years ago. Never looked back. 

Also, get a blog. 

I find Facebook useful to keep up with friends and relatives who happen to be on Facebook. This data would be interesting only if most of your friends were on Facebook, and that was your main way to communicate. If on the other hand you use Facebook to graze on ""news"" and viral posts, the only interesting metric is ""time wasted"" :-)

Use it for communication, leaving notes for myself and storing light amounts of data, a short text, and pictures in messenger.

Use it to interact with bots

I have 3 pages too, and run some ads, for ads it's a pretty good platform.

Used to use it to keep informed, followed some scientific pages, news pages and stuff. Just skip the s**tty stuff and go directly to the ""pages"" tab, can quickly fix FB, but now I find it terrible, Reddit and Flipboard do a waaaaaaaaay better job.

I used to defend FB when people said it was useless, but its devs recently said it's more profitable throwing at my face pictures of my relatives' cats than useful information, so I'm using it less and less.

Right of course! Who in a circle of friends I communicate with is super-valuable, but I'm not using facebook for that I'm using whatsapp or imessage. Do you use it alot? Like many messages/posts a week?

There was a great headline last week (or something) that talked about Flipboard's ridiculous 80m monthly active users? I was shocked, and am now going to back to see what all the fuss is about - I used to be a bit on the fence. 

1-2 posts per week...

I'm also in several Facebook groups, incl a Quantified Self group. I'd rather have those discussions elsewhere, but that's where the people are...

That’s probably not enough meaningful today. I’m so anxious to get past just steps and sleep! I might write a separate post about that.

Do any of you know of any that claim to be able to last all day? Do you have experience with recording your entire day?Relevant to my interests. Even something with rolling footage that let's you click something to save the last X minutes would be good too.

I remember when google glasses were announced this was one of the things I wanted most from them. A dashcam for my person would be wonderful.

Just some idea. Most action cameras, including GoPro, have a function called Loop, so unless you really need ALL day recording, it might be useful. About the battery life there's nothing you can do, maybe carry a big Li-Po battery to charge the camera, or extra batteries (for cameras that have removeable battery). And one last thing, I would recommend an external microphone if you want audio, like a micro-USB to 3.5mm adapter, otherwise it might be difficult to get audio from other people besides you.

Thanks, but I’m trying to avoid cameras that are so obvious that other people will ask me all the time. Onetime I strapped m iPhone to my head and live-streamed all day, and people kept asking me about it. I bet if I strap a GoPro to my chest the same thing would happen haha.

I’ve been looking into the snap spectacles and things like it because they really look like normal sunglasss so people generally won’t give you a second look. The problem is that there’s no way to customize the glasses behavior. They only take 10, 20, or 30 second clips when you press a button. I want constant recording. 

I'm thinking GoPro as well, even though you'd have to change the battery/memory cards. I don't think we've gotten close to that point of being able to have a 24 hour camera because most batteries won't last that long unless you get a massive camera and most memory cards won't hold that much for the same reason. Most 24/7 cameras are hardwired, like security cameras. However, you could go a GoPro set up to take pictures every X seconds (3,5, etc) which would create a kind of stop-motion type version of your day and would take up less space and battery life. You could also pretty easily disguise your GoPro by wearing a bag/backpack, strapping it on the shoulder strap, and putting it inside a small pouch like a military-style mollie gear pouch. 

Cheap android phone, power bank, usb otg cable, and any usb camera.  I'm currently setting up a system to do this with a bunch of other sensors using an old LG g4 and a 20000mAh Xiaomi mi bank. Still trying to find a camera that's small that I can rehouse in to something semi discreet. But my test rig just uses a 1080p webcam which was cheap from China.

I know I'm almost necroing this post, but...

Have you considered a Raspberry Pi Zero and Spy Camera module? If you add a powerbank and a simple case (or even one of the existing LiPo battery addons) you can easily record the whole day. There's even some RasPi distros dedicated to video recording! (Mainly for CCTV or surveilance use, but might be good enough for you).

The only drawback is that it's a DIY solution, and depending on which mode of recording you want, you'd need to invest in a hefty 400Gb SD card...

Food for thought!

That’s a great idea! I wish some of the sunglasses cameras had more open to developers so that we could create programs to run the way we want. 

Maybe I should create a developer friendly sunglasses camera...

Thanks for sharing this idea! I ended up getting a cheap aliexpress glasses camera. It holds 32gb and lasts the whole day if I plug it into an external battery... 

I like it because it's pretty portable and doesn't get in the way too much. I have a feeling the same can't be said about a Raspberry pi?

Well, I think with a bit of tinkering a RasPi ZW and external battery to last you the day could fit into an Altoids can or even a cigarrette 20-pack...

And then you can place the camera wherever it suits you, keeping in mind the constraint of the ribbon cable length (you can get longer and shorter ones depending on your needs).

I'm just curious about your goals for data collection in the new year. Will you be tracking anything new? Focusing on any new goals? Quantifying anything different? Changing your tracking method? All that good stuff. 

For me:
More closely tracking the demographics of the authors and books I read (I want to read more nonfiction and more non-American authors).

Food tracking/water intake

More time tracking for just a general idea of how I spend my time during the year. My goal is to track at least 75% of my time in more general categories and maybe evolve to more specific categories later (like going from general social media to Twitter, FB, Instagram, etc.)

Fitness tracking/measurements tracking/workout tracking

I'm sure I'll come up with other things throughout the year but I feel like this is a good start. What about everyone else? For more high level look at how you spend your time I enjoy using the life cycle app.

As for goals, I don't have any specific ones but I would like to 

* Exercise more days than last year. (More days than this month last year each month?)

* Lower my resting heart rate?

* Track hikes and see mileage trend increase

* Begin tracking blood pressure. (daily? weekly?)

* Make a meditation streak. Not sure what the goal should be.

I really want to drink more water but no tracking method has ever remotely helped me with that.

I’m just getting into it this year for the first time, so these aren’t goals for “this year”, they’re just goals. I have a private data account set up to trap data that I create on my iPhone, social accounts, and calendar. My goals are to:

Answer these questions:
- what data (if any) is important to quantify if I want to learn something interesting about myself (tracking for tracking’s sake isn’t enough)
- what can I learn from just my phone?
- what would a fly-on-the-walk analysis of my professional data (writing, communications, calendar) yield that’s of value to me / my employer

Grow health and athletics performance incrementally, starting from zero tracking:
- watt testing (monthly)
- max heart rate (is this growable?)
- hydration 

If I could get deep enough into doing this that a few of these happen automatically and I can just log into something to see how it’s going, that would be a win. Also, thanks for pointing me to Life Cycle! Love it. 

Life Cycle looks really nice but I have an Android so I can't download it. I use a time tracker app that I really like. It's just remembering to start my timers or go back and log my time because it's not automatic like Life Cycle. 

I highly recommend you look into hidrate spark. having my water intake automatically tracked, really helped me.

Awesome! I will put it on my wish list. Last time I saw something like that I think it was $200 so I just wrote it off.

How did you track your time? Do you have more detailed data, e.g. broken down by hour of day?

Why are Mindfulness, Music, and Mealtime all one category?

Also... how could you spend 1/5th of your year in that category???

It’s called “billable”

The green section is billable, which is how I track my working hours. There are some smaller slices that are unpaid work (admn for contract-based work, errands, etc). I'm a self-employed developer so I am afforded the luxury of essentially picking my own hours. 

This

I do. I have all my events logged in caldav format so I can manipulate it based on the RFC if I want to but in practice I use Google Calendar for the interface 

Cooking and music are meditative for me. I separated sleep out but I prioritize my time in the kitchen and with music... I'll easily play three hours some days, at least an hour most days. I edited the chart to include hygiene in that category as I usually track these things under a single calendar since they're all sort of ""dailies."" 

I try to extract a general idea of how I spent my year, blue being tasks that are simply part of being a healthy human, green being specific goal-oriented time usage and red being enjoyable but primarily non-productive events. 


How do you work so little?  

All your ""dailies"", social, sleep, and meditative time are on your calendar? 

Ah, so, it's not meditation at all, it's relaxing time. Gotcha.

I worked an average of 8 hrs/wk over the course of 2016, and an average of 29 hrs/wk over 2017. That's not accounting for non-billable work, i.e. administrative, research and project management hours. 

I also bill at a rate that is commensurate with what I need to survive. My debt to income ratio is sufficient and I value my free time more than most things. I'm probably some sort of statistical outlier.

Additionally, I spent three months intentionally not working in 2016 which skews things. 

Yep. Everything. [Here's an example](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xOKW99CjNUnKI4x28gWlbQ.png) of a week of tracking. My DMR block is my daily morning routine during which I usually do the same things, at least 5m of present mindfulness practicing attention. Hygiene, stretching, etc.

Edit: as you can see in this image I'm not very particular about how accurate my event tracking is. I just get the thing on the thing and call it good. 

> I'm probably some sort of statistical outlier.

I hope your stats will be average in x years (with x being sometime in my lifetime). 

I don't track absolutely EVERYTHING, but I get the broad strokes. 

Is it all filled in ahead of time or after the fact? I really appreciate sharing your strategy. 

6:1 after the fact, usually. I'm not great at following plans better at aligning actions towards goals and working on what I feel I'll be most productive at. It's a balancing act.

My ground rule: everything needs to be able to be tracked with minimal effort, otherwise I will most likely let it go after the initial ""I'm so inspired""-phase has gone by.



I should mention one thing before I start: I don't really look for correlations. I use the data to find patterns and look back. I like to look at the old data and see if it corresponds with my gutfeeling about how I am doing. Almost like looking back in an old journal to see if it was like you remembered it, or to see if you've changed. So, I'm not trying to try any hypothesis. I'm just trying to look back and improve.



I use [Zenobase](https://zenobase.com) as a hub for all my data. Sometimes I look for correaltions, but mainly I use it as a fancy viewer. Great wesbite!




**What I track passively:**

- Movies/tv: collected with Trakt. I watch most shows and movies on Netflix, and with [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/traktflix-netflix-and-tra/bmoemkaigjgcgjjnpmdgkifndiidkeji?hl=en) plugin I can transfer my netflix history into Trakt.
- Music. [LastFM](https://www.last.fm). I listen mostly with the Spotify app, which can be connected and sync to LastFM (doesn't work with chromecast though!).
- Movement and location. Tracked with [Moves](https://moves-app.com/) (iOS).
- Computer usage. Tracked with [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/).
- Programming time. Tracked with [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com).
- Meditation. Tracked with [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com) (iOS, Android). They allow data export on their website. (I think this counts as passive tracking since it gets tracked automaticly by using the timer in the app).



**What I track manually:**

- Podcasts. I take a screenshot of all the episodes I listen to. With a workflow, these get moved into an icloud folder with the time and date as a title. I then manually log these into [Mark's great podcasttracker](http://www.markwk.com). Shoot him an e-mail and he'll probably help you out!
- Studytime. Tracked with [Toggl](https://toggl.com). I have one project for each class I'm taking. I track all the time spent on classes (self study, lecture-time etc.)
- Sleep. Tracked with the ios app [SleepCycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com).
- Money. [YNAB](https://youneedabudget.com) all the way. Great methodology and software! (And if you're a student you can use it for free for a year.)
- Pills/vitamins. App: [Medisafe](https://medisafe.com/technology/) (iOS). Wish they would allow export and Apple Health sync. I use this mainly as a reminders app.



**What I would like to track:**

- Reading time/pages read per day. I've found two good apps for this: [BookOut](http://bookoutapp.com) and [Leio](http://leio.co/?i=1). However, none of these seem to allow dataexport, BookOut dosn't have an iPad app and Leio won't sync between devices. So I won't use them. The ideal thing would be to use an ebook reader that has timetracking buildt in.
- Food. I used [Lifesum](https://lifesum.com) (iOS) for a week, but I stopped because they don't support vitamins (which I want, since I'm worried about not getting enough B- and D-vitamins). So I switched to [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com) (iOS, web). However, to import all the recipes/food I eat is very tiresome, so I've put the ""tracking-all-the-food""-project on hold.
- Alcohol. Tracked with the app [IntelliDrink](http://www.intellidrink.com). However, one or two beers in I always forget to track. I've put this on hold. Frankly, I don't really care about tracking this. But it can be fun to trying to get the ""optimal buzz"" sometimes. (""...such a geek!"")
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/index.html) (spaced repetition app). they have a lot of stats, but I can't export it. Wish I could integrate it with the rest of my nice looking graphs!
- [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) (checklist/projects app) stats. I've been trying to export the completed tasks as csv files to get the total of ""checked"" items per day but I don't really get it to work as conveniently as I'd like. If this is a feature you want, you could use todoist. However, I'm two deep in the omnifocus-mud and can't get away from all the fancypantsy feautres.


**Suggestions for the people that are just digging the list of software and want more:**

- [Nomie](https://nomie.io). (Duh).
- [Nice](https://appadvice.com/app/nice-sex-tracker/1107291612) (iOS). Tracks sexual activity. When I tried it I felt so dirty. I don't really track this. Haha. 
- [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com) (iOS) survey based tracker. Asks you questions.
- [Momentum](https://momentum.cc), the best habit-tracker/""don't break the chain""-app I've ever found. If they only had an iPad app...

Merry christmas everyone!!You can track blood parameters within Microsoft's Healthvault. I use the website to track all my DR visit results

This is great! Thanks for sharing - hoping to get into some of this starting in the new year

Really left with wondering why bother if you don't do anything with it. To each their own, I guess, though!

I would further add that I would like to monitor my blood parameters - like glucosis, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and Tryglycerids - on an app. I do not know if there is such a thing neither which other blood parameters should be monitored

Zenobase question:

I notice the API changelog last entry is in 2015: https://zenobase.com/#/api/   Is this something to be concerned about? Does the platform seem to be dead/dying/heading that way?

Hi, I know I'm late but, why do you track your location history with Moves instead of with Google Maps?

Glad you appreaciated it! Good luck! :)

I see what you mean. But, I do do something with it. I look back on the data every so often, and I think I learn a ton about my behaviors by watching the bigger picture of the data (what goes up, what goes down. Am I doing as well/bad as I think I am?). What I don't do at the moment is comparing the different factors with each other, for example comparing sleep quality with movements in the day. Maybe I'll try that sometime in the future. :) 

You can track most of these in Cronometer.

> Does the platform seem to be dead/dying/heading that way?

I prefer to call it ""stable"" :-)

I am a bit concerned about this too! the creator does not seem to be as active as he used to be (facebook posts has slowed down, less development etc). /u/zenobase writes here sometimes. Hope he sees this!

I've had a good experience with Inside Tracker which is clinically integrated.

You can add nutrients by simply typing one line instead of clicking through menus, which can save a lot of time. So for example, you can just do *230g chicken breast*.  

It has about 15.000 items from the USDA and FNDDS database as well as about 400.000 branded items from openfoodfacts.org.

42 nutrients are supported and you can enter them directly as well.

You can download all your data anytime.

I also made an offline, command-line version that is [open source](https://github.com/vrublack/TacoShell).

a couple of weeks ago, I wanted to buy a new fitnesstracker because my previous one (Basis B1) was being discontinued. The more I checked out what is available, the more I got confused by all their marketing bullshit. I just wanted to know what devices have which features and functionality and there was no simple way to do so.

So I created one: http://fitnesstracker-database.com

On the site, you can set individual filters about what your tracker should be able to do, how much it should cost or what kind of analyses it could execute (https://imgur.com/oAvBrPe). You can then either go into some more details (https://imgur.com/JxNnsmn) or compare your favorite trackers with each other (https://imgur.com/jxqyRum).

The prices are based on Amazon and updated automatically multiple times each day.

What I would love to hear from this community: Are there any filters that you would love to be able to select? Which other trackers would you like to see on the site? And is there anything else you would want to do on this site?[deleted]

One suggestion: filter on integration with Google Fit and Apple Health.

A lot of the most-recommended ones have very closed ecosystems and don't integrate with Fit...

Could you add the Garmin tracker bands (vivosmart, vivosport, ect)?

BTW the Xiaomi wristband does have a supporting app. It's called Mi Fit. I found that when filtering for devices with apps only, it was removed.


RemindMe! Friday

A feature I'm searching for that's hard to get out of the marketing material is offline support. I don't want my data in ""the cloud"". I usually check if the device is supported by gadgetbridge - because it's easier to trust free software apps.

True, and I would love to already have it implemented, but there are a couple of problems:

Companies report their own numbers which are often not exactly accurate and I will start crowdsourcing this information, but I'm not exactly there yet.
Also, for some trackers you have battery life with and without e.g. GPS enabled. Finding a good logic for this is rather complex, e.g. what happens if you filter for >10 hours with GPS enabled if trackers do not have built in GPS sensors?

But yeah, it's definitely on the roadmap and with very high priority :)

Great idea, will probably also add direct integration with Strava as well! 

For sure, will be added over the next couple of days!

Original Build: I wear it on my middle finger and no issues w/ the build during my oly lifts/kettle bells/pull-ups.  I haven't scratched it!  Though, these activities are not what it's meant for.
Data Quality: I've been able to enhance what I didn't know I needed enhancing (SLEEP and hourly movements). The data is what this device is about.
The battery is MEH, but it's two-year-old ring sized battery technology.  It meets my expectations.

I have always just subjectively evaluated how I look/feel/progress after each distinct period of training, but I think this is inadequate. I need an objective measure of performance.

I realize this depends largely on the goal of exercise (aethestic vs performance vs general sense of wellbeing), but I'm just trying to hear some ideas to get inspired.

So what goalposts are you using?I'd planning to now and am looking forward to seeing what other  people have done.  I've been preparing for my first ultramarathon and have been doing some very data collection on my training so far.

The main key has been getting a baseline idea of what is ""normal"", but I feel like in my case, that means that I can't just take in workout routines, I also need sleep and diet data.  I've been getting that alone with weekly/daily distance, average speed, and weight lifting.  

I'm especially interested in doing some testing on how different workouts 1 or 2 days prior to my distance run impact my performance on that day.  

I'd be thrilled to hear ideas other people have had for this though!

It's a good idea to capture objective data, but that doesn't necessarily replace the subjective data. For example, you can count how many pull-ups you can do, but that's meaningless unless you also capture _how well_ you did the pull-ups.

I think subjective micro-surveys/notes about how you feel after every workout might be effective to a certain extent. As long as you consistently document/track this, it could prove to be a worthy goalpost.

I've started doing this.

It's a lot better than just subjectively evaluating workouts at random points in time, often weeks apart.

It's led to hypotheses about the factors that may be affecting the quality of my workouts and my health in general (i.e. sleep quality, work stress, etc.)

Also, I disagree wholeheartedly with your example. Unless you're a beginner, there shouldn't be such wide variance in the execution of different exercises. Usually, such a marked change in form would come from doing an excercise to failure, which would be apparent in the rep count or the notes you take. Do you A/B test your workout routines?

* Prolactin as a proxy for a bunch of other hormones (also Walk In Lab for $40ish). 
* Occasional vitamin D testing ($50ish from Life Extension) since I tend to be very low.

Thanks!Have you tried the Google timeline feature on Google maps? I find it quite similar to moves in terms of functionality and find it a bit better than moves in terms of battery demand. 
Also, depending on what you'd like to do with that information, Google checkout will allow you download your entire location history as a kml file or a json file, which I find handy.

Arc and Lifecycle are two options that I use. Arc still suffers from turning off in the background, but is better about notifying you that this happened than Moves. I'm not sure about options for export or impact to battery life.

Google's timeline feature works well, however the Google *Takeout* export does not currently include any place names, just coordinates, which makes it a lot less useful.

Arc seems to be a pretty good fit for what I’m after, so thanks!

Here's a mock of what I'm thinking - https://marvelapp.com/56eb2ib - It's work-based right now, but the categories could easily be personal ones, e.g. workout, read, hangout with family etc.Hi OP,
Interesting idea and nice work putting the mock-up together in marvel. I currently keep track of time I spend doing certain activities including reading etc each week and this idea appeals to me. 

The main challenge I see with it is in order to get useful information between the difference of expected time vs actual requires a lot of time and energy making daily estimations for multiple activities (as often daily expectations will be different depending on activities/other plans) which would probably put me off unless I was gaining a lot of value from it.

The other option is to go with a flat daily target for every day/week. But in this situation, the app turns into many of the other binary daily goal apps where either you achieved the target or not.

I would also be interested to know how you would plan on handling the time tracking element itself.

Hope that helps!

Thanks for all your feedback!

Yes I see the planning aspect as a major barrier right now, so for this to work planning has to be quick and easy. I wonder if there’s anyone on /r/QuantifiedSelf or /r/productivity who does this kind of planning already. 

The daily target you mentioned could be time-based, e.g. read for 1 hour, work on DIY project for 2 hours. I guess it’s another level of detail for people who want to go beyond just tracking whether they did something or not, and to quantify how long they spent doing a certain thing. 

Another option is to have templates, where you can setup a few different routines and just drop those into your calendar, rather than plan from scratch every time. Might take some time to setup initially, but templates would make daily planning quicker. 

As for the time tracking element, I was thinking of using a timer system, so you can just start/stop the timer against an activity. And potentially pull in data from other time tracking tools, so people can continue to use the tools they have. Would that be useful to you?

Passive apps/devices tho, I love. What am I missing here that you know about?

Automatic: plugs into the serial port in my car, use IFTTT to log all trips and ignition on/off. All that is required is initial setup of device, and IFTTT setup with google drive.

Nokia Thermo: the easiest way to log my body temperature I’ve found. Put it in my bathroom, and just take a second to use it every time I’m in the bathroom.

iHealth Pulse Oxymiter: Also in my bathroom. Usually put this on when I’m taking my temperature with the thermo.

Nokia Body Scale: also in the bathroom. Get on this whenever I take a shower.

Whistle: track my dog’s activity. IFTTT to google docs

IFTTT iOS Contacts: add a row to google docs when I add a contact to my iOS contacts.

Apple Watch: Workouts mostly, and (passivley) too many other things to mention really. Also my access point for data from other devices like Thermo and the Body Scale.

Pillow iOS app: (with Apple Watch) to track my sleep

iHealth Glucometer: this is the most time consuming, but I take my fasting blood glucose every morning. I do not have diabetes... just keeping tabs.

Nokia BPM+: I actually don’t use this much at all bc of all the factors you really should take into account to take a proper BP measurement, but I’m working to try and incorporate this more. BP is more valuable than my blood glucose, for example, but it’s just more time consuming to do it right.

IFTTT for weather and all sorts of other things... write to google docs


Some day I will care to create a timeline of sorts with the years of data I’ve been collecting. Until then, the more I can passivley log, the better.

Any other suggestions?

Thanks

I also use the Moment iOS app to How much I use my iPhone, and app usage. And a device called SensorPush that measures temperature and humidity in whatever room I put it in.- [Moves](https://moves-app.com/) for recording a timeline of where you spend your time

Found this post, which is somewhat similar to my question: https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/1sf12o/what_else_could_i_track/

Fitbit is probably the main passive tracking I use. For active tracking, I use Nomie which is an awesome app. I do have a few things automatically going to Nomie like how long I slept or my weight when I step on my withings scale.

If you're asking for a temperature and humidity tracking platform, I'd say to check out [MbientLab](https://mbientlab.com). The MetaTracker will do that for you and you get the data through their free App.

Have you used the Moves app lately? It’s been crashing for me.

I’m on iOS 11.1.2 (iPhone 7)

The app worked when I first downloaded it, and I think the iOS 11.1.2 broke the app. Not sure. Others seem to be having this problem also, but at recent times prior to my iOS update.

Are you still using the app? Any other apps like Moves that you know of?

I run this - https://betterself.io

It's definitely a bit more active though, but it aggregates from passive areas.

I forgot about Last.fm scrobbling. I don’t totally understand how it works, but apparently it can only scribble tracks that you have downloaded locally. I use Apple Music.

Thanks!

Oooo I like the idea of Nomie. I’m definitely going to see if I can work this into my days. I had thought about using IFTTT’s DO buttons for something like this, but Nomie seems like a better implementation to that end. Thank you.

Does the app allow you to plan what you want to do? And show you your plan versus what actually happened?

It's incredibly useful for someone like me who has ADHD. Tapping on an activity means that I'm now allowing myself to start that activity, and holding myself accountable to stick to that one thing.
It makes you aware how much time you're wasting in your average time. I was spending at least 5 hours a day texting when I first started it. You'd be surprised how quickly these things add up. 

It also has the added benefit of being able to look back and knowing exactly what you were doing at a particular time and date.

You can plan in advance yes but it's not something I've played around with so I can't comment much on. I'd recommend you get it and see if it works for your needs, it's free after all!

That's awesome. I'm so glad it's working for you. I've used it for the past few days and am really enjoying it. It helps me focus. I'm not ADHD but I tend to have a really bad sense of how much time has passed so if I'm doing something boring, it's hard for me to focus because I think I've been working for an hour but it's only been fifteen minutes. The opposite is true for fun stuff and I can waste hours doing a lot of nothing because it feels like it hasn't been that long.
I need to add more activities to make it more efficient but I'm really liking it.

Not exactly the same app, but looks similar. I'll check it out, thanks! Do you think it's good?

I think I’ll do just that! Thanks

I'm so glad you're enjoying it! I feel the same way. Especially with gaming and series, they're such a time sink. Also in time you'll start noticing patterns in how much time you waste. So for me in particular, after 20 minutes I get the urge to look at the app and switch tasks, so I'm pretty good at knowing how long 20 minutes are now.

I think this is something that would help you as well. Set alarms for 20 minutes and it'll annoy you for 2-3 days tops. After that, you can disable alarms cause I promise you that your brain will still remember how long 20 minutes are!

Yes, search the app store e.g. for ""stroop test"". However, you may be able to focus for a few minutes and perform well on such tests even when sleep-deprived.

Another, more simple test to see if you are getting enough sleep is the [spoon test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOKPcMFWPds).

There may be methods for monitoring tiredness continuously using physiological signals such as eye movement; don't know if anything like that is available commercially yet.

Can you answer a simpler question, that I find incredible is hard to find a measure for:

What is a marker for feeling energetic, amped, with a clear head etc.

It is the opposite to fatigue.

I have been trying to measure this myself and have the following lines of investigation:

* Blood sugar

* Subjective scale of 1 to 10 of how energetic you are (this is odd, as I can see measurement as higher but my performance shows lower).

* Reflex speed

* Emotional measurement (one word survey to ask how you feel, but also I have used several emotion diagrams to survey - daylio is pretty solid and I can see a correlation  between feelings and energy : If I am exhausted I feel defeated, if I am stressed then I feel more tired etc).

* Quantified mind is a great resource and different tests. I find it amazing that I can feel happy think I am alert and enrlergised but see some impacts that I associate with Fatigue e.g. lower cognitive results where I have missed say a half hour of sleep.

* The NZ high performance sport people have a leap test that measures vertical jump and acceleration (it is like a cell phone accelerometer they put on their thigh before doing a jump test). This measures muscle speed and energy. They measure morning and night to track fatigue.

* Beep test could be another way to measure raw muscle work rate.

* I also use a home EEG machine to measure prefrontal cortex. I see fatigue mainly shows up in a lack of concentration or ability to meditate. Also a sharp and erratic flitting between different wave types (alpha etc) binaural music has a very clear and immediate response to both my subjective perception of state (emotions and energy) as well as brain wave patterns. I see my task output increase such as dollars per hour when selling in an energised but calm state, and also I improve my subjective ability to solve software bugs in code when in a meditative state.

* there are a lot more fatigue measures than ""energy"" measures. Especially in the trucking and military research.

* The trucking industry has a measure which is % of time with eyelid covering pupil. Blinking is a measure of higher cognitive process, and deep fatigue can be associated with dropping eyelids.

* there are many emotional measures from webcam input so that can be used for emotional tracking during work days. (Self measure of emotion on continuous webcam feed). 

I have wanted a way to measure mitochondria as well as that seems like a good way to also track it.


In conclusion, I am yet to find a better tool than subjective ""on a scale from 1 to 10 how energised do you feel (1 being fatigued and 10 being energised)""

Would love to hear more.

If you have a vague definition it's hard to measure anything really. If you have a solid, clear definition, it's often also hard to measure anyway haha.

>What is a marker for feeling energetic, amped, with a clear head etc.

To measure ""feeling energetic"" I'd ask on a 0-100 scale ""How energetic do you feel?""

I don't know what ""amped"" means phenomenologically. I don't think I've ever said, ""I feel amped right now"".

To measure clear-headedness, I might give some kind of deductive reasoning task and measure the time it takes, as well as accuracy. But that's what I'd define as ""clear-headedness"", and that's a pretty narrow operationalization.

UPDATE: Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I have experimented with most of the mentioned tools thoroughly, but I wanted to extend this question to the community to make sure that I haven't missed out on anything obvious and that anyone bridging the ""beginner-intermediate"" gap in future on this sub has a place to start. 

A special shout out to u/ErikBjare for bringing up spreadsheets. This is, by far, one of the greatest and most overlooked tools. 

Tools mentioned here:

- https://zenobase.com/

## [ActivityWatch](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/)

Open-source, privacy-aware and extensible time tracker that I'm developing since I got fed up with existing services like RescueTime. Feedback greatly appreciated.

## [Zenobase](https://zenobase.com)

Great for getting data out of services into a decent dataformat and getting a basic overview of it.

## [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net)

Not really a QS tool, but great for synchronizing sensitive QS data without a third party like Dropbox or Google Drive.

## Spreadsheets

Everyone should know this, but newcomers might not realize that spreadsheets are great for trying out logging new things. Logging things manually in them can be pretty time-consuming however, so don't use them for things that need to be logged frequently. Google Spreadsheets works alright on mobile too, which is a plus. 

QualityTime (Android) or Moment (iOS) and RescueTime to log time spent on your phone and computer. I didn't realise how much time I was spending on tumblr, or how many times I unlocked my phone every day until I started using these. 

Nomie! 

It’s incredibly simple, but at the same time allows you to track pretty much anything. Has got pretty good data visualisation too.

I just wish I could integrate some of my auto-tracked stuff into it like sleep/exercise from google fit or Fitbit. Maybe I’ll have a play around either the API to see if I can rig something. I like the fact you can easily export data into .csv’s 

I love exist too. Has a monthly fee but I enjoy the bar graph layout and how you can see trends and correlations easily. 

Some kind of nomie/exist hybrid would be my dream tracker.

Once you have the data from all the different data collection platforms, you can try out the analysis tool I have running at 
http://www.my-statistical-health.com
... functional early version, emphasis on proper statistics analysis of QS data, e.g. does my coffee intake affect my sleep patterns when taking multi-day delay into account, etc etc. Anything with data basically goes. Feedback very welcome. Code is here:
https://github.com/lassefolkersen/my-statistical-health

Welltory uses your phone's camera to track your stress and energy levels by measuring your heart rythms, and it does so much more than that. 

It acts as a hub for every other tracking app and service you have to automatically log how your activities affect your overall health and well-being. 

For example I have it hooked up to apps like rescue time and Pillow to track how my physiological stress and energy levels affect my productivity and sleep, and vice versa. 

Nomie is amazing, but I still find that the load-time is too long for many things. Also, I dislike being tied to my phone as a tracking platform because it leads me to distraction. Also (and I'm sure this is being worked on) Nomie URLs + Workflow on iOS works great for speeding up the process, but sometimes just fails if the app wasn't open recently. Maybe I just need a hardware upgrade. On every other metric, I give Nomie 10/10.

Nomie for android is an embedded webkit view, ie takes 8~10s to open the app. Completely useless in my case. The idea is great, but looks like we need to start an OSS project to do it better.

This is a brilliant comment! I'll give ActivityWatch a look when I get time in the future. Spreadsheets (and Google Sheets in particular) are a great tool, but something I completely didn't think of mentioning. IFTTT and Workflow integrations are great too.


Moment and RescueTime have been very eye-opening!

If you do start working around with the API, please open source on GitHub. I'd love to contribute to a project of that nature.

edit: d’oh, sorry. appears it’s still ios only 

RescueTime is great, though it appears to track only with hour granularity, so you can't answer questions like ""how often do I unlock the phone"", or ""how long is my average phone session"".

This doesn't exactly give you unlock counts or total session time, but you can do 

    resolution_time=minute

Thank you! :)Not a fan of talking, but I track every movie/book/episode I've watched as well as all of my flights and trips. Also got a collection of movie theater, theater, opera tickets, but lack a good tool to put that into data. Got a list of all computer games I played and every song I listen to. Tracking every running/cycling activity as well.
Also working on acquiring as many pictures as possible that were taken of me ever, but that's a real challenge. 
 
It's like a diary, but based on factual data not on memories. It's interesting to discover trends and phases, but also great for taking a trip down memory lane and rediscover things you already forgot.

Agree with above that I'm not a huge fan of talking but I also track a lot of stuff. I've spent a while using fitness trackers to track steps, recently got one that includes sleep so I'm tracking that now. I track workouts (including weight/reps) and am now using a time logger tracker to track daily activities. The next step is to move into food and wellness, tracking diet, macros, etc. 

For me, it's about being more mindful and deliberate about the things that I do. I can waste a lot of time not doing much of anything. I spent two years working a full-time job, getting my Master's, completing a practicum placement, presenting at several professional conferences, and trying to maintain my relationship. When I got done with that, it's like I hit a brick wall and did nothing. Quantifying certain things about my life, especially task/time-related things, actually keeps me from wasting time. 

Awesome, thanks for that!

Are you also using any of this data to also find ways to change something about you/your behavior?

Hmm, past data not really. The awareness helps, like with tracking flights I am more aware of how large my CO2 footprint is, to not overdo with flying around. Also with sport tracking it's a challenge to do more and to get better/faster.

But for changing behavior I rather use ""todo""lists, like the future oriented version of tracking. I have lists for movies I want to watch, countries I want to see, buildings I want to visit, computer games I want to play, books I want to read, towns I want to visit, etc. - They are somewhat extrapolated from my past data, because when I notice that Korean cinema has produced awesome dramas after 2004 it is a pattern I learned which will make it more likely that more drama movies from Korea post-2004 will end up in my watchlist.

Exist.io does good analysis, though only on a day-by-day basis.. By which I mean that it wouldn't distinguish between say meditating in the morning vs the evening, they're both just ""on that day"".

Currently it doesn't support numerical attributes for ""custom"" events - which your noot intake would be - but you could track which noots you took each day. Numerical values for custom tags are apparently a planned feature. I also use a mi band 2 and currently I use Tasker to get my sleep and steps data into exist, though you can get partial integration by using Google Fit. Partial here just means tracking a limited set of measures like only time asleep, vs that plus time in bed, number of awakenings, etc.

[Zenobase](https://zenobase.com/) is quite flexible and lets you do basic analyses, though it doesn't have built-in support for the Mi Band.

Im planning on working on one soon. I'll keep you updated if you'd like me too.

I'm building a tool to help with this - with a focus on enabling me to apply the scientific method to my own life. Been super frustrated with existing tools that basically just give me data porn, but nothing really actionable.

Kind of thinking I'm going to try and find one as soon as possible, but wouldn't mind an update when you're ready.

**What would be the best way to start tracking and organising my life?**
I have tried diaries before but, I often forget to take them with me. Is there an app anyone recommends? Open to all suggestions about anything and everything.Check out r/adhd. There’s a wealth of advice in there. 

Personally (as a person with ADHD) I keep track of everything with a time and date in my phone/laptop calendar. Even down to reminders to do something later in the day or even just in the next hour. Like I’ll put in an event with alert for “check the letterbox”, because otherwise I’ll forget. 

I also keep a plain Notes file for jotting one liner notes into on my phone, as the come to mind. I then sift through that list periodically through the day to make sure I haven’t missed anything. Once a thought is no longer relevant I can remove it from the note. 

I also keep multiple shopping lists on my phone. One list for everyday shopping items (toilet paper, toothpaste, milk, etc) and another for once off items (new tshirts, new USB cable for phone, etc). 

I also keep detailed timesheets of all my productive activities throughout every day, to make sure that I’m achieving things at a consistent rate. 

For tracking what you’ve done, you can use the detailed calendar events as not just reminders but also a history to look back on. 

I also rely heavily on my own location and activity tracking app. But I don’t want to plug it here again, because it feels a bit too self promotiony ;) But if you check my posting history you’ll find it. 

Or even... a list of the most important things to logg would be nice too?


This is not exactly QS stuff, but as I also follow R/Microbiome this dropped in my inbox this week. I've no affiliation with this, but I did watch the free webinar (requires registration). 
http://nourishinghope.com/get-started-guide

I'm very curious how you've gotten on with your journey now. Have you found any metrics that you benefit from tracking?

Currently researching different ways to incorporate the concept of quantified self to symptoms people with ADHD experience. Of course, putting the link back to making the data clear enough to be able to extract meaningful trends that we could use to adjust our habits/surroundings is the most difficult here.


Would love to hear your findings on this.

The offline QS community has provided me with feedback during the building process and I would like to get feedback from users here on the product and if they see if providing any value to QS users or users that are just starting to get into the QS movement with the purchase of a Fitbit/apple watch - details of all widgets displayed can be found on the website [www.mangomirror.com](https://www.mangomirror.com).

It would be great if you get a chance to review it and have any questions of comments on this product to help improve it. Thanks in advance.Would be neat if this had an open API that people can use to post their own data for display.

The possibilities are endless! Dashboard services like [Geckoboard](https://www.geckoboard.com/) typically provide an API for adding custom data, in addition to their built-in integrations.

Interesting read. My biggest question is, what would happen if he stopped taking all these supplements and drugs right now and keep doing the rest.

Very interesting. I think he’s making a big mistake about avoiding salt while trying to eat a keto diet. Also his assertion about salt and blood pressure is coming into some big questions right now (latest research from space station about salt does not hold up) 

Interesting article. I dig it. I find the idea of taking prophylactic metformin at once terrifying and intriguing. 

His workout routine is similar to my baseline, and I do the lithium microdose thing, with noted positive effects on my resistance to stress (purely anecdotal, of course).

Calm, fitter, happier and more productive. A pig in a cage on antibiotics.

The metformin thing made me go ""ಠ_ಠ"" when I read it. What brand of lithium are you taking and have you been charting your average mood too? I’m 32 and spent $200k on biohacking.

Cheerios
Interesting idea. I'd heard of a little bit about some of this before --- not much. I'm not sure how much I connected with it. I think I'm fairly aware of how clearly I'm thinking, or how alert I am. But I'm not accustomed to there being something I can do about it --- at least over the very short-term. I need rest, food, exercise, less distractions, an end to pain, etc.

Last, and definitely least, I think there's a missing word here:
We identified composite EEG features in the literature that would provide useful as we grinded out work.

Thanks for the feedback! The picture emerging from behavioral neuroscience is of workflow optimiziation as a highly sophisticated resource management problem. We are generally familiar with the coarse controls that you mentioned, and I would certainly not understate the importance of those, but our moment to moment thinking habits and decisions are fair game for refactoring as well ;) For example, when faced with a challenging problem at work, do you consider your current working memory load before ingesting solutions to similar problems? A short walk can clear WM and prevent accumulation of associated fatigue. At what frequency do you oscillate between verbal and intuitive cognitive modes when searching for a solution? You have probably used coffee to enhance productivity at one point or another. Other nootropics and forms of ""entrainment"" have proven useful for cognitive enhancement, but directly correlating doses with neural activity could enable optimal drug/stimulus selection and dosing on a personalized basis.

I'm really glad to hear that your interested. Feel free to send any other feedback or ideas whenever. Also, yes, thanks for pointing out the typo!

I'm thinking something like https://exist.io, or https://gyrosco.pe, that I would run on my own machine, that collates the data, and maybe provides some built in reports.

What spreadsheet do you use, and how are you providing data to it?

I just use Excel. It's huge now. Every morning I input about 200 different data points which are logged and analyzed. I think some people would call it quantitative journaling. But I also import quicken data, a csv of my outlook sked, and life goals.

Here's one of many shots: http://imgur.com/Xx3FrVH

This has been very helpful to my life. I think more people should do it. I've sometimes thought that I should build a website that does this.

How do you put that data in, how do you gather, etc?

Wow, that's extreme! And cool. 

Wow, do you think you could upload a template so that we could see the types of variables you track? That sounds incredibly useful.

I stumbled upon this app about two weeks ago and have been very impressed with the level of data it provides. It tracks 9 heart data points including heart rate variability and if one has a blood pressure monitor it can compute even more. Thought this might be of use to the community here so wanted to share.

Looks interesting. As a user of HRV4Training, I know how useful HRV feedback can be. I'm wondering about the ""energy level"" metric and if there is any validity to it.

It would be nice if they put out more information about how accurate their system is compared to professional equipment, and more info about the energy level calculations, etc. I would definitely take the energy level readings with a grain of salt and plan to use it to identify long term trends rather than individual day info.

You can't calculate an ""energy level"" from nothing but heart rate data. That's why serious apps like HRV4Training have you answer a bunch of questions about how you are feeling etc before giving any recommendations.

It's a ternary plot. I made this using R, specifically the ggtern package. So 99% of the work in making this plot was done by a kind contributor to the R community.

The ggtern plot also lets you plot heat maps of the data - and that showed the central tendency of the data being much more clustered.

So what I would ideally like is a record of which apps I was actively using and during what time periods, and for apps that involve documents the name of the documents I had open, and whether I was reading them or editing them.  For Gmail, I would like a record of which individual emails I had open and for what time period, and whether I was writing them or only reading.  And for browsing I'd like a record of what URL was in the active tab for what time period.
  
I don't know if this is a tall order or not.  Having the exact information I described would be much more useful than the easier, more general form of record that tells things like, gmail was open in a tab from 1-4 pm (but not how much of the time I was using that tab, and which emails I was looking at when).  I am willing to go to a fair amount of effort to gather the detailed info, but of course I'm hoping there's a way to do it that's not too much of a nuisance.

All I currently need is a text record of the info I described. I don't need an app that will crunch the data, display it as a graph, etc.  I use a work Mac, a home Mac and and iPhone, all synced. I do all my browsing with Safari, and all my email with Gmail (using gmail by going to the Gmail site using Safari). I'm hoping there's some kind of spyware that employers use that I can use to spy on myself!  

I realize that to get the info I want I may need to look under the surface, so to speak, at files I don't usually look at.  If you are going to advise me to do that, please bear in mind that I am not a tech professional.  I am pretty fluent at using my computers and smart phone, but have no experience with rooting around in system files -- so if you tell me to do that, please spell out clearly exactly where I should look.

Thanks!Have you tried RescueTime already?  It does most of what you want.  I don't think it has a way to automatically track whether you're reading documents vs editing them, but then again I don't think anything off the shelf does that (not that it couldn't be done by an actual app developer).

My iPhone 7 and Apple Watch are the main drivers for collecting data. 

On the software side of things, I rely on Apple’s Health app for actually aggregating everything on the fitness end. Mood tracking is one of my emphasis in my QS regiment, which is based around the app StatistiCal. For keeping track of location, I use Moves which pairs with Gyroscope for really solid analysis of my data.

I also wear my watch at night to keep monitoring my heart rate round the clock and to get sleep analysis via AutoSleep. 

Other apps like Swarm, Apple’s Activity, and Moments round out my regularly used collection methods. It’s a little fragmented, as not everything works together. But these have been the most reliable ways to collect/analyze data on the go. Every once and awhile I throw all the data into a Numbers spreadsheet and make some reports for better analysis, but I find most of these apps do the trick. 

I use Jefit for weightlifting, My Fitness Pal for calories, and an old fashioned spreadsheet for about 200 other things. What is your Quantified Self Toolset?

It may take a week or two to calibrate yourself, but it's all relative, so you develop a sense over time. That's how measurement in psychology works: you just write down a question and give it a numeric scale. It's nonsense on its own, but once you have three months of data, you will have an internal sense of what ""8.5"" means vs what ""4.5"" means.

This is something I focused on when developing my mood tracking app StatistiCal. Of the 6 different attributes it records, two relate to your overall alertness. On the one hand you have tiredness, while on the other you have energy. The former is how well rested you are, with energy being just how alert and energized you feel. Pairing both together I think gives a pretty solid repository of these subjective feelings.

Is there anything like this on Android platform?

Thanks!Google Fit can store [all these metrics](https://developers.google.com/fit/android/data-types).

I want to run self-experiments such as a testosterone program. I take base-supplements - a multi vitamin plus D3 plus dig enzymes. I then want to take an extra supplement for a week and each day I want to journal plus add custom stats such as happiness, energy levels, sex drive, etc.

Ideally I'd like an Android+web synced app, however I will settle for just one if need be.

I can find tracking apps but they don't allow you to see what they relate to unless I give the stats very custom names.

I'm happy to forego the journaling or just do that separately.

Alternatively, if someone could recommend a stats tracker that allows stats to be grouped into 'folders', plus custom notes against each entry. I want to be able to compare multiple stats against each other, either through aggregated assumptions which I've seen done in one app that I can't recall the name of. It would say things like 'when it rains you stay go out less', in this case 'when you take supplement x your energy levels increase'. But a simple graph with multiple data sets would do.

A good colourful, modern UI would be great!

Thanks heaps!I'm using Nomie to track a variety of stuff, and I'm doing a coursera course to learn Tableau so I can do better analysis. 

Get an app that makes logging the data as convenient as possible and that lets you export the data (some good ones are KeepTrack, Nomie, TapLog, and Trackthisforme). Then use a separate tool to do the analysis (Zenobase, or a general-purpose data analysis tool like R). Don't go looking for random correlations, but come up with hypotheses to test first.

We just launched a new feature in Exist (https://exist.io) that might solve this for you. It's called custom tracking: https://exist.io/blog/introducing-custom-tracking/

Exist is designed to find correlations and trends for you in your data. We have a daily mood rating feature that lets you add a short note and rate your day from 1-5, and we connect to lots of other apps via APIs. But with custom tracking you can now create tags to track anything you want, and you just add those tags on the days they apply. The app will find correlations for you without you doing anything after you've got enough data in your account.

How do you plan on getting your data from Nomie to tableau?

Thanks! Nomie 2 is pretty close to perfect :)

Any general-puprose data tools that don't require coding? Otherwise I will just plug away at understanding Zenobase

Haven't gotten that far yet. Nomie Backes up to a json file on Dropbox, shouldn't that be convertible to csv? 

I'm sure that's possible but I've never done it. I have my Nomie data synced to CouchDB. I'm not great with NoSQL, so I wrote a Python script to pull the data from CouchDB into a MySQL database.

> To be able to curb the global pandemic of physical inactivity1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and the associated 5.3 million deaths per year2, we need to understand the basic principles that govern physical activity. However, there is a lack of large-scale measurements of physical activity patterns across free-living populations worldwide1, 6. Here we leverage the wide usage of smartphones with built-in accelerometry to measure physical activity at the global scale. We study a dataset consisting of 68 million days of physical activity for 717,527 people, giving us a window into activity in 111 countries across the globe. We find inequality in how activity is distributed within countries and that this inequality is a better predictor of obesity prevalence in the population than average activity volume. Reduced activity in females contributes to a large portion of the observed activity inequality. Aspects of the built environment, such as the walkability of a city, are associated with a smaller gender gap in activity and lower activity inequality. In more walkable cities, activity is greater throughout the day and throughout the week, across age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) groups, with the greatest increases in activity found for females. Our findings have implications for global public health policy and urban planning and highlight the role of activity inequality and the built environment in improving physical activity and health.

The inequality is interesting although I would not jump to the causal inference so readily. Looking at figure 3, there's a clear connection between physical activity inequality and development/wealth. In the US and other rich countries, not getting much exercise is a *choice*; and the richer and more developed the country, the more you have the freedom to hang yourself with your own preferences ([genetic in origin](https://www.gwern.net/docs/genetics/2016-plomin.pdf ""Finding 7: Most measures of the 'environment' show significant genetic influence"") or otherwise).

I'm willing to pay if I can keep my information private, so are there any other paid premium alternatives that doesn't collect personal information?


Edited: Typo in the title, I got a extra ""you"" there.I'd recommend the Nomie app. Search for it on iOS or Android. It is fully private and local and supports backup to Dropbox in case you lose your device. It has a lot of powerful options, but is simple to get started with.

[removed]

Looking at https://www.askmeevery.com/privacy, what makes you think that personal information is ""up for grabs for the right price""?

Evolution 2 looks like a very promising service, but if you are paranoid about privacy: ""Evolution 2 may partner with advertising or other partners to provide users with targeted and useful contextual advertisements or related services.""

What makes you think it isn't after reading the privacy policy?

[removed]

Nothing wrong with that, and a fair price for using a free service. Just need to be aware that information leaks, e.g. when an advertiser targets people with a weight loss goal using a custom referrer link. 

What's important from a privacy point of view is the ""right to be forgotten"", so people can have their data removed any time. This is especially true if the terms of use or privacy policy can change any time.

Evolution2.co and Evolution2.com are very different sites haha. 

Edited: As for your question I would prefer a paid subscription service with no logging of personal information. I know people needs to make money to support their services, that saying if you are not paying for it you are the product is very true. I think the best example would be ProtonMail I believe? They don't log anything and they are very successful. You can restrict some features for free users, grow your free user base while providing better features for premium users. I actually think no logging can be used as very effective marketing strategy. It just creeps me out when I think about a service that I use to log my life and I gave them the rights to trade my info even its just anonymously. That being said its just my opinion. I know Google, Microsoft, Facebook are doing this exact same thing right now, linkdin was acquired for billions because of this exact same reason. The thing is (I'm not trying to offend you in anyway) I know Google, I know Apple but I don't know Evolution2.co I feel its alright to sign my info's away to big players because I trust them even thou its just the same thing with all the smaller sites.

I’m the developer for Coffee It. Compare to markets caffeine tracking app in iOS, I have to say I made all the need it should have with a free price for now! It have most common brands in USA coffee types, brands, but since I mostly drinking Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts, you can always request a new type of coffee date to add in the library. Also, it have an History view for you to see how much you take total today, that comparing to the limit caffeine a day(300mg), what the percentage you doing in that.

With Customize List and Favorite List, you can make your own list of whatever coffee type, homemade etc. And in favorite list, you can click a coffee and add it with only one step which is super awesome fast! (For history view, I’m doing a function for user to click a history caffeine log to quick add that type, which will be even faster if you mostly drinking the serval types of coffee).

The app have some minority function like showing the badge for ‘1’ forever(until you close the function), to let you put Coffee It inside a folder and then 3D Touch the folder to quick open the app. 

The thing Coffee It miss now is data analysis, which is always important for myself. Unfortunately, I’m a self-learning junior student, that cannot put all my effort into it, but I’m always trying to combine what I learned about analysis and in the future, Coffee It will definitely have more function.

I know there are still much more to improve of the app. So Please, if you’re a coffee lover, that also loved to take count on how much caffeine you drink(qualified life style), try the app and give me feedback I can indeed to improve it.

Thanks for sharing. Any plans to support time ranges (e.g. for step counts)? Also, are you familiar with [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/)? They went through a similar exercise...


This is a cool project - but have you considered just using HL7? As that's the data format that everything from your Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) through to all the diagnostic machines in the hospital use. I think even the iPhone Health app can handle HL7 (in CDA format, which is HL7 derived).

Open mHealth sounds interesting - I would like to see if the industry standard or an open source initiative wins out long term in the mobile space. Despite all the formal medical records, and movement of data within the hospital/clinic being HL7 - it looks like there aren't that many apps that use it - at least in diabetes between 2010 and 2015 (http://www.openaccessjournals.com/articles/mobile-applications-for-people-with-diabetes-published-between-2010-and-2015.pdf)

It'd funny, there are so many different diet plans these days..

I feel that most of the quantified self people are pushing hard on to either low carb, complex / slow carb or no carb / high fats / Keto type diets, it has been a while since I have seen a high carb plan.

Some old school sports diets tend to push a higher carb diet, but I always felt lethargic and fat when I was on them, even when training hard.

It's so hard to find a good clean steer on vitamin and macro balances that are backed by a ton of good research. So much of it is conflicted. It would be so nice to have a best practice/ official diet that science says is best.

i read that apple bought [beddit] (www.beddit.com) and the reviews were very good so i bought one and 1-week in i am very happy

you place a cloth strip under your top sheet and at the level of your heart and it gives good and i believe accurate information to the bluetooth linked iphone app

measures heart rate, sleep quality, snoring, breathing, waking time, sleep time and gives you a nice set of graphs



I've been tracking my sleep every night for over 3 years now. I did a similar study 2 years ago. Spent one month tethered to several devices, from straps to adhesive patches, to wrist bands, to bedding, to non-contact. My take away was to take a step back. The purpose of sleep is recovery. Good recovery leads to wakefulness during the day. Wakefulness is linked to quality of life. I found that keeping tabs on sleep duration, consistency of sleep patterns, and mood during the day was more impactful and useful than knowing deep vs light or rem or HR - b/c I can change my routines for better sleep - but it's hard to change my REM or HR... I think the purpose for tracking anything is to be able to take action - most sleep trackers give too much data, get lots in the minutia, and are not yet smart enough to adapt their algorithms to the individual physiological needs of different people. 

YW, its not too often that I find good reviews like this that aren't sponsored by some company or that aren't plastered with affiliate links.

My view is that companies will keep gather data from users, and use it for profit. Kind of inevitable, but at the same time not as bad as it might seem, if we consider better recommendations, advice, personalization and overall services improvements.

Awesome, thanks! I want to try Apple's Healthkit some more. Right now I've only seen that it gives me number of steps, but I know it has much more than that.

I totally second this. I'm using so many apps / services to measure data about myself, but at the end of the day, I still can't distill it down to 'pointers on how to improve'

Awesome, thanks

Visit exist.io. You will shit your pants.

Quick question: what apps/services are you using? I'm trying to find more **automatic** trackers (I'm currently using: FitBit, Moves, MyFitnessPal, and WakaTime).

What, specifically, are you trying to improve? Are you trying to be more active?

I've been keeping an eye on their road map, waiting for a few services I use to get integrated or manual csv imports to become a thing 

I use Moves, RescueTime, Healthkit (I have an Apple Watch). 

The non automatic ones would be: Reporter, Nomie, Pocket Expense. 

No, not that. I'm trying to me more mentally focussed and productive. So, creating and identifying habits around it. Improving general well-being and happiness too. 

Exist co-founder here. Just wanted to mention that we just launched custom tracking, which might help fill the gaps in the data you want included. It lets you track as a binary anything you can think of, just by tagging your day with tags you create yourself. There's some more info on use-cases and how it works here: https://exist.io/blog/introducing-custom-tracking/

What's the most popular on Android? On iPhone? What are their pros and cons? What features do people want? Are the apps already providing them, or are they still lacking? I also use the Google Location History feature. It's creepy but very useful.

I've been using [Geolicious](https://appsto.re/ca/A-w_L.i) for a few years and love it. It's like a private little Foursquare allowing me to check in to wherever I'd like, personal and public places with no worry about that data being public. 

I've also been using Moves for more movement type data but your app looks pretty neat too. 

I've been using Moves for over 2 years, but just tried your app and absolutely love it. If only you supported migration of Moves data.

I love your app! Amazing UI/UX. Do you have any plans for adding data export or sync?

I use the timeline feature in Google Maps. I used to use Moves years ago but I grew tired of always carrying around a battery pack. 

You can get decent data formats out by using Google Takeout. For higher-res data (runs, bicycling, etc.) I use RunKeeper. 

Tried your app, love the UI. is there a way to export the data? 

Arc is so great and amazing compare to Moves, only things is, moves have plenty 3rd apps support, I using Gyroscope a lot and move export to export gpx file to import into Fog of World. 
If you can support gpx export to dropbox daily, and for gyroscope if you have gpx export, it will not be difficult to contact gyroscope to support Arc data. These two improvement will give you more users! And I will definitely give up Moves at all! 

Interesting!

I use Foursquare / Swarm for my checkins, but also rely on my app to record everything, so that I've still got a record of any places I forgot to do a Swarm checkin for. 

How well does Geolicious work? Is the accuracy good? 

Yeah, data import would be great. Though might be quite a big challenge. 

I actually lost all my Moves data recently. I had many, many years worth of data, it just deleted it. There's some fuck up in their login process on new phones, I think. Somehow it decided to treat me as a new user, so I lost everything :(

Thanks :D Yep! I started looking at an export system for the latest release, but ended up setting it aside until I've got the time to do it right. But hopefully can get into finishing it up soon. 

I'll also be wanting to build a proper API for it, so it can be hooked into third party services. Though that'll have to come after the export feature, as it's a fair bit more work. 

Google's Timeline feature looks really cool. I like that they are attempting to automatically distinguish between cars, trains, buses, etc. Though I'm not sure how high their accuracy is yet. 

It's a shame they haven't made it available for iPhone yet. I can only view their Timeline by opening it in a web browser. Though at least it still records from iPhone. 

Moves is actually very battery efficient these days. They've optimised it a lot. It's still slightly easier on the battery than my own app, though I'm working to get mine as battery efficient as Moves. 

The data exported from Google used to only include coordinates, no place names etc. Not sure if that's still true, but that is a major drawback compared to e.g. Moves, which has a good (and complete) API.

Thanks! 

There's no export feature yet, but I'm tentatively planning to put it into the next release. (I do a new release about once a week). 

Thanks!

I've started on GPX support, and the absolute basics are already available (open a path/trip timeline item and scroll to the bottom, then you'll see ""Export to GPX""). Although it's an ongoing project to get full GPX support, but I hope to have it finished up soon.

A daily export to Dropbox sounds a cool idea! Would you prefer it to be automatic? Or just to have the ability to export an entire day to Dropbox with a button tap? 

For connecting to things like Gyroscope, that's a bigger project. One of the difficulties there is Arc's privacy model makes providing an external API quite difficult. Your personal data is very much locked up securely in your private iCloud container, and can't be shared with third parties easily, even if you want to. But ... I'm working on some ideas for that, and it'll happen eventually :) 

Accuracy is really good though it's a lot more manual. I'm in the habit now of wherever I go, I pull out my phone and do a quick check in. You can set auto check in for places you be at often which works quite well. So I never have to manually check into home but as I go about my day I pull out my phone and check in to places as I go. 

It uses foursquare data to prepopulate a list for you, or you can create a custom entry. The Foursquare place is then copied to your local DB so it's private and editable if desired. 

>I actually lost all my Moves data recently. I had many, many years worth of data, it just deleted it. There's some fuck up in their login process on new phones, I think. Somehow it decided to treat me as a new user, so I lost everything :( 

Now that you mention it, something similar happened to me. Too long ago for me to remember exactly what happened however.

If your app stores location data as discreet lat long pairs, then creating a CSV import shouldn't be ridiculously difficult. I have my Moves data regularly backed up by their easy to use API. For now, I'll use both Moves and yours, but hope to switch to yours exclusively in the future. I'm sure you have a lot going on, and have already done a stellar job. It has worked very accurately for me so far.

Awesome. If you need any help, let me know! I have quite a bit of experience in iOS & API development.

Plus you can also export Google Maps data (I think). 

Awesome, I do some analysis on my data from different sources so need something I can export if it's to replace Moves.

Do you also have an idea of iOS battery usage vs Moves.

And thanks for replying so quickly!

Ha all good news! Automatically sync to dropbox will be greate! With a .gpx file of a total day will be fantastic!

I wasn't quite sure what happened with mine. It was a new phone, I installed the app, I went to sign in via Facebook, and ... something went wrong.

Like the Moves app said the wrong thing, said something that sounded like it was setting up as a new account, even though I'd had it connected to my Facebook already literally for years. Then ... no data. Devastating.

I still use Moves, alongside my own app, because Moves uses very little battery, and I'm still fond of it. But it doesn't have all the extra data and features that I want these days. 

Glad to hear it's getting good accuracy! It's still very early days for the app, so it doesn't have many users. And because it's a machine learning engine, the more people using it, the smarter it gets. 

You'll probably notice that if you tap the bottom left button, it shows ""local knowledge very low"" at the top of the options menu. Basically it says ""very low"" for almost everywhere in the world so far. Heh. But it's gradually getting better. 

The trick with an import is Arc App requires a lot more information beyond just coordinates (for example accelerometer and pedometer data). Otherwise it can't determine the activity type of each data point. 

Although there could be a way around that, if at least the imported data is already tagged with activity types. Could just mark the imported events as being from an external source, and not capable of being processed further. 

Thanks :)

It uses more battery than Moves on most days, though it can vary a lot. Depending on the device model and usage patterns, it can be anything from using just slightly less than Moves up to using two or three times as much as Moves.

Though I'm always working to improve the energy efficiency. And the release that just went live today should have some big energy savings. So maybe it's much closer now. 

I'll probably do the data export feature in a few stages. First stage will be something simple, with perhaps just exporting some standard formats between given date ranges.

Eventually I want to have a full API for it, so you can plug your data into other services. But that'll be quite a bit more work, so will come later. 

Cool :) I've put it on the todo list. 

I'll get full day GPX export working and shipped, then look into how to get it auto synced to Dropbox. Might not be too difficult :) 

❤️ and for accuarcy, when using moves if you are going to a place that really next to the current place then it will not detect as a new pkace, how Arc will be? I'm aware that this maybe a problem can't solve since the accurance of rhe gpx?

Arc should detect it :) Arc can detect separate places down to a separation of about 10 metres. And it gets better at detecting them the more times you visit them (and tap the red dots, to help it learn). 

Also, if Arc doesn't automatically recognise them as two separate places, you can tap on the single visit it created, then scroll down to ""Recorded Activities"", and can then tap on the separate places in the list there, to separate them out into individual timeline items. 

woo! this is sweet, convenient and comprehensive! will try after I out of home! And I see there is a major update for improvement of power using, is that still up to a lot of battery? Also, Swarm implement is great! But is swarm api can allow you directly check in in Arc without leaving?

Battery use is progressively getting better, although it's already good enough to get full days of recording without needing any extra charging. But I keep chipping away at it, optimising more when I can. 

For Swarm checkins, I really want to hook it up to the API directly, but just haven't had the spare time to do it yet. 

I want to be able to toggle a switch on places to basically say ""Do auto checkins for this place"", so that as soon as Arc realises I'm there (and has reasonable confidence that it's not a mistake), it'll automatically do the checkin for me. 

I'll get that one made eventually. But there's not a lot of people using the Swarm checkins yet, so it's lower priority.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0T7b2_GYkd49a3VZV_eR06gor-kyb_9I5j6EL-7aHg/edit?usp=sharingYour diet consists of almost entirely of packaged food, and that is fuel for everything else you do. I don't entire understand everything you are tracking, but this is the biggest thing that jumped out at me.

I would say switch to a vegetarian diet for a month, but nachos can technically be vegetarian. Look into eating an entirely plant based diet and more vegetables in general. 

Here is a video I made on eating plant based meals, hopefully you can take something away from it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCFl2ZKxtgA&t=29s

Invest some time in understanding what foods you are putting inside you. It will be worth it.

A few questions, first:
What correlations did you find with your IOP?
How did you go about analyzing the data?

Also, I think more importantly, have you consulted a doctor (or some kind of professional) on the matter? And if so, what did they say and what do you make of it?

If it's body stiffness related pain:

If it's neuropathy: 

I heard L-carnitine might help. I can't confirm this though. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcarnitine

I agree with the general sentiment.

It doesn't even have to be vegetarian in order to cut out processed foods (although that's fine and good too - vegetables are awesome!).

The easiest thing OP can do at the grocery store, is shop exclusively from the perimeter (where all the fresh foods are: vegetables, fruits, nuts, dairy, eggs, fresh breads, and meats), and never from the aisles (except for non-food stuffs, like toilet paper, and select spices). Done.


Is there any actual examples of people with chronic pain being fixed by switching diets?

exercise and sex correlated to spikes

i recorded it then mapped each variable against pressure and looked for which happened (yes or no) at time of IOP >20

then i followed up with taking pressure directly before and after the action and each hour after for confirmation

i see an eye doctor every 6 months
glaucoma occurs on old dying people there is not much research - but he has compared my anecdote against his other patients, found it holds true, and so we're going with it as true enough

there have been studies on yoga and that does spike IOP

however IOP was an example of an experiment i completed, i am now interested in joint pain, perhaps i should have left those examples out.

actually asleep seems hard, for attempted sleep i text at sleep, i text at wake up, and give a rough note - took forever to fall aslep, poor quality, etc


Who are some guys who are thinking about this? I'd be interested in checking out their work

Processed foods have been credibly linked to headaches. Though I'm unaware of any research showing links to generalised chronic pain. 

I don't agree with GP's recommendation of switching to a vegetarian diet. I think that's an unnecessary step too far, and would also modify too many variables at once, making it difficult to judge any causal relationships. But the general sentiment of eliminating processed foods does seem like a high priority first step.

> Is there any actual examples of people with chronic pain being fixed by switching diets?

There's plenty of anecdotal evidence (search e.g. anti inflammatory diet my chronic pain), but keep in mind that placebos have been shown, in some cases, [to reduce chronic pain as well as pharmaceutical painkillers](http://www.nature.com/news/strong-placebo-response-thwarts-painkiller-trials-1.18511).

I have one question though, why use correlation? Correlation doesn't make sense to me as your primary metric. 

Imagine the following scenario: You slept for 8 hours every night. Each device as a random margin of error of +/- 5 minutes of your actual sleep time. This would show a correlation near 0 even though each device is very accurate! 

Do you have any ""golden"" measurements for how long you were in bed? Like from a clock? A better metric might be deviation from that measure (even if it has a bias).

I actually built [a sleep detection app](http://www.bigpaua.com/ifalarm/screenshots/) some years back, and one of the big things I learnt is that most smartphone apps at the time (and still now) are largely faking it. Their sleep report graphs are often almost entirely bogus. 

Actigraphy is not easy, and especially so when you don't have a controlled environment. So it appeared to me as though most developers simply said ""fuck it"" and faked up almost every detail except for the asleep / awake detection. 

I suspect a lot of the wearables and dedicated sleep recording devices available now are still doing the same.

For my app, I went as far as using solid science to detect light and deep sleep, and made a heuristics based attempt at even detecting REM sleep. But it required fine tuning for each user over a period of time. 

I also showed real hypnograms, instead of the nonsense graphs that most apps are showing these days. I'm still disappointed that app couldn't support itself financially. Sigh. 

Ouch, that sucks. I'd been using a fitbit watch for a while but also found that the data was piling up and that I didn't have time to constantly manually clean up when it thought I went to sleep or woke up (it comes with a way to manually start and stop, but habits are tough to change). Last I checked the fitbit download policy isn't much better: they have the data but you can only download it if you pay a yearly subscription.

Feeling burned out with quantified self?

Regarding the use of simple correlation to measure agreement between several methods, [see this paper](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/meas/ba.pdf). But even if all the apps agreed, they might all be equally inaccurate...

Even if none of these apps get the sleep phases right, the overall sleep scores might still correlate with your subjective feeling of how well you slept. At worst, you should have a record of how much time you spent in bed, which can be useful in itself.

hmm, red and blue seem to have an almost perfect inverse correlation from that graph, while green stays in the middle between.

I stopped tracking sleep data when I switched to an Apple Watch but honestly I never found the data all that useful even after about 5 years of tracking it.  

Yeah - sounds about right. After 3.5 years of tracking my sleep (only missed one week) - I've found that just tracking total sleep duration, consistency of habits (time to bed, time getting up), and mood was more reliable, individualized, and actionable. I just use aTimeLogger on Android and put the mood in the comments. Export CSV to R - regressions and correlations for days.

Any plans for an Android version?

I found it useful to build custom alarms with the data. 

http://www.bigpaua.com/ifalarm/examples/

Like, an alarm that will only wake me up after I've had at least 6.5 hours of real sleep (not just time lying in bed).

Even my iOS version isn't available anymore. It's too difficult to compete in that market. There's too many apps, and the most popular are popular because of marketing and high Bullshit Factors. So I got out of the market completely.

It was fun, but there's no money to be made there if your goal is to ship a good honest product.

The desire here is to clear the fogginess of what/when/why coding in their behaviors and to analyze their own habits collectively and as objectively as possible. Unlike feelings, numbers are constant and can be manipulated to find answers to questions we have about ourselves as individuals. Sometimes this means showing ourselves that strongly-held beliefs are less real or true than we first thought. Other times the QS itself builds enough awareness of our behaviors to correct them (using MyFitnessPal to count calories, in so doing, eating less and losing weight simply because we’re looking more closely at it). 

The effectiveness of QS lies in the fact that numbers ARE king. They don’t lie, they’re (usually) not subjective, and they are consistent. 1 is 1, always has been, always will be. A number doesn’t get sad or take a day off, it is exactly as it states and because of that it can be used. We can move data to study when/how long we spend performing certain activities (Looking at you, Reddit!) and oftentimes shockingly discover how little time we spend studying in an average week and how MUCH time we spent on the Playstation in a month. 

Where the individual can excel is in taking responsibility for the data. Data doesn’t lie. If you’re not exercising, the data can tell you. It is then your responsibility, and no one else’s, to change that data. Not by lying to your QS Standing Protocol but by exercising. Assuming consistency of your Standing Protocol, the data changes, the outcome changes, but in reality what changed was YOU. Your reward isn’t just better numbers but a healthier body and a better quality of life.

So now let’s get down to the nitty-gritty.

In order for QS to be the most-effective and motivating, it must begin with a goal. Otherwise we are gathering abstract data for no reason or a just-in-case reason. Now, I recognize some people find value in this and take great comfort in it and that is perfectly fine. However, I am of the impression that the general population is interested in changing specific numbers and patterns. In most cases **the more precise the goal, the more precise the answer** because then we can tailor what data is collected and not have an overload of otherwise unnecessary data.

Secondly, QS is founded in the first word of its name. **The results must be a numerical value.** Even if the data is more abstract, such as a pain level, it should be recorded as a numerical value (1-10) so that it can be measured against your other numerical values. Your initial quantification of a non-numerical value may be lacking accuracy, but over time you will establish a greater degree of accuracy because you can relate it to your prior numbers. In the case of pain, your first day you may list a 10 but the second day the pain is even higher, in which case that is your new 10. As more values are entered, you can establish a greater feel for the relativity. Now, ideally, you’re measuring numbers to begin with (such as a blood glucose level) but if you’re not, it is still possible even if less than ideal.

Third, **The data is only as good as it is consistent**, so make an effort to track consistently. Missing data can be hard to replace. In the case of hormones, cortisol and insulin vary throughout the day based on behaviors, caloric intake, exercise, and the even less quantifiable Circadian Rhythm. So documenting weight at the same time every day (say, morning right after a shower) is more ideal than having some right after lunch, some before bed, and others “on a whim.”

Fourth, **Own the Answers**. If you’re doing the data collection right, being consistent, and the data correlates to your goal, take responsibility for the answers. Even if it’s uncomfortable, it’s better to know and not like it than to live in the dark. After all, if you don’t measure it, you can’t manage it.

Now, this is a nice little kickstart to QS and what it means but any Veteran QS-er is already going to be aware of these points. Where the QS community can stand to see the most improvement, in my own humble opinion, is in the Own the Answers element. I’ve seen a lot of frustration about the lack of technology/apps/insert_excuse_here and though I understand and share the sentiment, see little-to-no point in complaining unless the person complaining accepts responsibility to do something about it. I recognize this is a radical concept for some out there, but this is legitimately the only way something is going to change. If an app could stand to be tweaked or modified, contact the creators and write reviews or even write your own app. You can hire people to do this, actually, but it’s not cheap. However, crowd-sourcing and funding CAN be viable to create a solution with enough people on-board. As we move to solutions, we create an environment people want to join. One that is both emerging quickly, and very exciting. 

I simply believe that at this time the QS community can benefit greatly from both Standardizing For Newbies as well as Staying Solution-Oriented. The first to grow our community and the second because at its most basic level is a part of the QS culture.Though I very much agree with your plea here, there are a few things I'd like to point out, if you don't mind.

In your statement, you're talking about how data doesn't lie. In theory, this is correct. However, in practise measurement tools can be unreliable and invalid. Take activity trackers for example and take a look at [this](http://hhs.surfsharekit.nl:8080/get/smpid:56544/DS1) paper. Three out of the ten studied activity trackers, displayed a wrong amount of steps.

Now take a look at the (Sleep Cycle)[https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/sleep-cycle-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8] app. It's a very popular app to track your sleeping habits and to wake you up during your light sleep phase. It works by listening to the amount of sounds created during your sleep, while the golden standard of measuring sleep is to measure your brainwaves (as far as I know). Doing a quick search on Pubmed, I wasn't able to find a single study to determine the reliability and validity of Sleep Cycle. This app might actually give you wrong numbers.

Another important aspect of Quantified Self is statistics. What's the correlation between measurement a and measurement b? Sometimes it may appear that there is a relation between certain measurements. We can make this sure by applying statistical analysis on data. However, not everyone is cut out to do this, which could let them misinterpreted their data.

I think we have to grow our community, so we can create more standards of measurement. This includes more research on reliability and validity of measurement tools.

Common ""newbie"" mistakes:

- Taking data at face value (not understanding the limitations and inaccuracies of the data)
- Treating the human body as a linear system (as most ""diets"" do).
- Failing to take variation into account (e.g. weight lost/gained is less than typical weight fluctuations)
- Focusing on the wrong goals.

The nice thing about QS is that it encourages people to educate themselves and figure out things. How to make this process appealing to a broader set of people is an interesting challenge...


I agree with your sentiment about standardization, but I think that points 1 to 3 you mention can largely be solved with the right product/technology.

On point.

I would just add that development is needed, rather than research, when it comes to reliability/validity of measurement tools. The people selling the tools (i.e. fitbits, jawbones, etc.) should be the ones providing evidence of the reliability of their tools... and I mean actual third-party papers.

True, but there's a way to systematically reduce these ""newbie"" mistakes. 

If you want to grow the QS community, make things easier to track, automate the generation of insights from data, make those insights understandable, and go a step further by recommending/predicting lifestyle changes. I think that's doable.

I totally agree. We need new and better measurement tools

Doable, but easier said than done :-)

Just out of curiosity, what would you want to be able to track if the tech existed?

To be honest, I'm working on it. 

I think the biggest challenge is on the data collection side, though.

Every few months, I run a small (safe) experiment on myself. Historically, I've used a personal log / Google Docs. 

I want to take things to the next level and build a ""dashboard for my body"". (Hey, if my car has a dashboard with a dozen KPIs, why can't I?)

Looking for advice on apps / devices I can use to harvest as much data on my body as possible. 

FYI, I'm also toying around with publishing all of this on a blog.

Thanks in advance. 

Nomie.io has been good for me for things that I can't already automatically track like steps, food, and sleep. Specifically, I use it to track things like energy, mood, specific stuff like headaches and upset stomach issues. 
The app lets you make custom trackers and different dashboards to sort them. 

Doing something similar myself. 

I'm using IFTTT and Zapier to pull in data from Fitbit, Automatic (for my truck), Moves, Smarter Time (Android) and Instant by Emberify into Google Sheets. 

That data is then pulled into Excel and linked to Access or imply left in Sheets for use in Google Data Studio or Tableau. 

In my ideal scenario, I would have SSIS pulling all that data into Sql Server and then reporting built or data fed to Tableau/Power BI.



I have a fairly manual process because of the ""siloing"" of health/fitness data. My Garmin watch tracks steps/activity/workouts and does a rudimentary job of tracking sleep. I use MFP for tracking diet and daily weight numbers. I manually record eating window (breakfast/dinner times), alcohol intake, supplement usage, and a few other numbers. Training Peaks, Strava, and SmashRun all get the Garmin data and I pull some specific numbers from each of those sources to track my running (specifically looking at TSS, Pa:Hr coupling, and grade adjusted pace by mile split).

My manual process looks like pulling this data in on a daily basis into an Excel spreadsheet—takes about 1-2 minutes each morning. The spreadsheet then aggregates weekly data and has some calculated and statistical fields. I find comprehensive tracking (getting every possible data point) has very low yield and instead have found a smaller number of data points to provide the most value (kind of an 80/20 principle thing). I do periodically test new data points for 3-4 weeks to see if they provide any valuable insights; if they do I integrate them. I also run periodic observational experiments on myself, with a short term (3-6 week) intervention and then evaluating its effects. I look for both expected benefits and expected side effects (based on prior research for a given intervention) and also any correlated changes in other variables I'm tracking. I have a background in clinical research so I approach my n=1 experiments similarly. 

If you do end up publishing a blog or podcast, post it here! I'm fascinated by what people are doing in this space. 

Your car needs a dashboard so you know when you're about to run out of gas etc. Hopefully you're not so out of touch with your body that you need an app to tell you when to ""refuel"", or if something is wrong!

Dashboards can be educational (and motivating) for some people, but otherwise you're better off figuring out what you're interested in (e.g. does nootropic x do anything for me?), collecting the data you need to validate your hypothesis, and (once you have enough data) doing the analysis (charts optional).

There are some measures that can be useful to collect as a ""baseline"" even before doing specific experiments:

- activity levels (e.g. with a Fitbit)
- sleep schedule (e.g. Fitbit or Emfit QS)
- computer time (e.g. RescueTime)
- location (e.g. Moves or Google Location History)
- resting heart rate and HRV once a day (e.g. Emfit QS or HRV4Training)
- body weight (e.g. Fitbit or Withings)
- blood work once or twice a year (e.g. InsideTracker or WellnessFX)
- mental performance (e.g. Quantified Mind)


Depending on what data you want to track and which services you use, you might find my app useful: [Exist](https://exist.io/). It combines lots of data, including weather, productivity/tasks, GitHub commits, workouts and general activity, sleep, and mood tracking into a dashboard. It also analyses your data to find correlations and trends for you.

Fitness Syncer [https://www.fitnesssyncer.com] claims to do that. If you try it please report back of your experience. 

Reporter App for iPhone. I use it to track how I'm feeling, am I being productive, what's helping me be productive, what's hindering me from being productive. It records your steps, ambient sound level, if you've taken photos, location, and all sorts of info. It sends out 6 random ""survey's"" a day where you create questions that it asks you. Can save to Dropbox as a CSV. It's excellent. 

But I've never heard of Nomie and apparently people love it. I'm going to give that a try now.

Nomie rules

You can use Workflow to pull in any data from the Health app (like number of steps) into Nomie. You can then use Launch Center Pro to set a notification to do it every day. I have it set up to put my average heart rate, number of steps, and sleep time into Nomie every day.

I have already spent an entire weekend switching my system and now I see holes in the desired outcome. I've looked online not alot of QS forums/active so hopefully you all can help out.

Background; So I'm a GTD'er..who gotten into QS data and combined that with a daily/weekly/monthly (DWM) review cycles.

The PERFECT app would be GRID Diary in which i had created custom templates aka questions for DWM reviews.
Examples: How many tasks completed, pomodor cycles, how long did I sleep, etc

The issue is lets say its 1 March - you can't have multiple templates for a day; so I can't use the daily & monthly overlays on the app which stinks.

So...I moved on to air table which i love its easy visual DB tool..however its still a bit cumbersome i have tabs in the app for month but than i realized I can't again have mixed DB fields for DWM questions...

On my list to test is google sheets/forms but just feels a bit clunky
I'm eyeing another iOS app for my ipad pro (primary computer) called Ninox full version is $15
Also thinking about DevON THink to go however I dont have a Mac so not sure how that would work..

Pleaset let me know if yall have any suggestions I'm not against paying for apps.. and like I said needs to work iphone/ipad and a web component would be a bonus

Here's a pic of what I'm trying to convey

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwf4zt1kXVrTbDBIWjB4elJYVlU/view

Have you checked out Nomie app?

I wanted to follow up I was able to solve this quandary; guess I was a bit impaitient in learning air table. So I created a master DB hoping I could have weekly, daily month into one DB. No go -- so I have 3 DB within air table for (weekly, daily monthly - questions) and I have created a record of the questions blank as template. Here how the workflow works each month i duplicate the template and use that for creating new set of questions for each day/month/week. 

I would possibly go the google docs route with a desivned front end, (you could even use html).

They have google graphs that can do some pretty epic graphs, heat maps etc.

And year after year, when I do this, I find that the tools have not improved. You still need to be a scientist and use R. The tools are shit and no one is even trying. 

Everyone has a hundred different suggestions for apps and wearables but absolutely zero ideas on how to actually use the data. 

I still track because simply looking at my own charts is fun. But saying that I'm learning anything is a lie. Even with decent skills in R, I'm incapable of using my data. I would suggest that the failure of tools to really help is not due to a ""lack of trying"". You can get correlations, or pretty plots of various forms of data using excel - and new software shows up to visualize QS data very frequently (I am working on such software in my spare time too!).

The problem is that the data just shows us where we are, and not how to get somewhere else - it is frequently just a detailed exposition of what we already know.

It boils down to the question: ""What change can I make in my life to achieve goal X?"". For example, I want to become more productive. I can find out if I made more keystrokes on days after exercising, or if my subjective ratings of productivity are higher. Usually, the answer is ""maybe just a bit, if you plot it right"". While some correlations are cool to see (just as you mentioned), I found my data lacking in fundamental insight by itself. One issue is that the data I have gathered is not NEARLY detailed enough to do a truly in-depth analysis (to be fair, I have only tried basic linear models). But the underlying problem is deeper than that.

Even if you somehow gathered extremely detailed data about everything, it's still not enough to change your life. The issue is that correlation does not imply causation. For example, my data suggested that waking up early on weekends was lightly correlated with productivity. So I set my alarm... and ended up wasting that weekend being completely sleep deprived.

Even though that attempt was a failure, experiment is the only way I know for gaining insight from data. Data can be used for making educated guesses - but it is actually trying various things, and seeing what changes in your data that might lead to something. It might mean changing your diet for a month, or changing the time you go to sleep. It will probably turn out that most things don't really change much. I'd liken it to being a scientist - where you are the test subject, and your data shows you the effect things have on you.

That being said, there is one case where quantified self data by itself is extremely effective: when you have a specific metric for your goal, and know what needs to be done. If your goal is to lose weight, then you know how far you are from your goal by weighing yourself, and you also know how to get there (stay within the given calorie range!). In those cases, the data turns out to be useful as a way to focus attention. All you need is extreme determination...

TL;DR: Gaining insight from data by itself is really hard. Experiments are (hopefully) the answer.

Using data to improve things is not exactly new or poorly understood. Read Deming's books from decades ago, 

You seem to be hung up on flashy data analysis, as opposed to actually making your life better.

Book that might help: ""You can measure anything"".

I've circled back around to the QS after a long bout of frustration about pretty much precisely this. It's very difficult to get actionable data. I've struggling, too, to convince my colleagues (and myself) there's value in taking their blood pressure every day. Two thoughts on this:
1) As real-boethis suggested, the key does seem to be about setting objectives before deciding what data to gather rather than vice versa. This is, needless to say, not trivial.

2) Another thought on this is that many of the wearables measure very wishy-washy, subjective, or gray-area metrics like sleep quality, number of steps, time spent doing X, etc. Perhaps the QS movement at large needs to make the step of doing true biological/chemical analysis of the body. The emerging (and existing) power of biotech is being able to measure the concentration of biomolecules and biomarkers in practically real-time. The obvious example is glucose levels in the body. I've been, for example, looking at how one might measure cortisol levels too look at chronic stress. The tools are expensive at the moment, perhaps prohibitively so. I think it goes to emphasize, though, that we need to be on the forefront of developing and pushing development of new tests and tools.

Gosh I wrote a lengthy post to introduce myself (auto removed).. i am a human looking for help so i'm going to respond to get my karama points up...

Have you looked into tableau.. for visualization?


Someone needs to talk to the people in charge of IBM's Watson

Out of curiosity, what is your system now? are you exporting data from a number of sources and just have it sitting loose on your computer? or do you have some system of bringing it into spreadsheets? 

Hold on... what is your data, specifically? You mean your activity metrics & sleep data, right?


What keystroke logger do you use?

The scientific method also is a really valuable thing. 

Recording and saving data isnt a bad thing, as there may be uses later that are as yet, unknown.

DMAIC has helped me more than nearly any diet or work out advice I've received in my life.

I  second this. In order for the field to grow in popularity, the people DOING it must cultivate it, study it, and pioneer new tech/research. It's not going to fall out of the sky, we must take responsibility for it. Isn't that what QS is all about, anyways?

> rity, the 

I agree wholeheartedly with you on point #2. I'm actually trying to build a startup around this.

In regards to point #1, do you track things such as blood pressure because you know it can lead to very particular insights? Or are you hoping to find associations between the data and your health after examining what you've recorded?

I personally use the pre-release of [ConnectorDB](https://connectordb.io), which comes with a keystroke count logger, but that is overkill if you want to gather statistics from your desktop. I'd suggest looking at:

* [ulogme](https://github.com/karpathy/ulogme) - ubuntu/osx, has pretty visualizations
* [selfspy](https://github.com/gurgeh/selfspy) - linux/osx/windows, gathers lots of data, and enables some aggregation queries
* [thyme](https://github.com/sourcegraph/thyme) - linux/osx/windows, while it doesn't gather keystrokes, it does gather detailed computer usage info, and generates a really great-looking overview of your activity.

Saving and recording data costs time and effort. 

Wasting time recording low value data detracts from achieving your goals. 

Yes!

I track lots of things and it has been life-changing for me. 

But just recording random data with no particular goal in mind is unlikely to lead anywhere much.

Thanks so much!

But again, CICO tracking _is_ something these devices can assist in, which is the way to lose weight. Necessary? No. Helpful? If you use it right, yes. 

I've also noticed a really fun, light hearted social element to it also. Plenty of people I know with trackers like to talk about step counts, not as a competitive thing just a bit of silly chit chat.

The obsession with peak fitness and drastic lifestyle changes has a lot to do with self tracking being a more niche activity I think, as it's the some what hardcore and very vocal minority who've defined what self tracking culture is in many peoples minds.

I also want to be able to download minute-by-minute data.  It seems like fitbit does not let you do that.  Are there any options that do?Xiaomi Miband 1S will do this with the MiBand Tools app.

Fitbit does give you minute-by-minute data, but you need to retrieve that data through their (rate-limited...) API: https://dev.fitbit.com/docs/activity/#get-activity-intraday-time-series

[deleted]

I tried fitbit and 2 generations of mi band. The mi band are cheap but it sucks to get HR data. Fitbit's HR data is more convenient.

This might be old information as I haven't worked with the fitbit api during the last year.
It is not true that you cannot get minute-by-minute data from fitbit. You can get second-by-second data with their API (intraday data). It is a pain if you don't know some programming. Maybe an external service provides downloads of your data. 

If you already have a fitbit and want your data, pm me.

But both of them return values in BPM and that is not optimal for HR analysis. You want the sensor's values or HRV. HRV is what's used in papers.

I am still looking to replace my fitbit HR for a band that saves HRV or direct signal of the sensors.

What happens in 3 days?

""with the MiBand Tools app""

It's a measly 150 requests per *hour*, though you can request to have the limit increased a bit... Check the `Fitbit-Rate-Limit-Limit` header in API responses.

150 requests per user per hour. 1 request can be ""all heart rate data for date x"". This request could return what they call ""intraday HR"", which can be data in BPM for every second when the fitbit got a count.

Unless you want live HR at a speed faster than 150/60min, the limit is good.

The values are in BPM and this is not optimal for analysis. Most academic papers use heart rate variability to analyse HR data.

The description for our study that was accepted is as follows:

*""Who controls the data from Quantified Self apps? The data from Quantified Self apps creates a new layer of complexity around agency, ownership, privacy and security of personal data in a Big Data world. Growth of the QS industry and community invites a deeper conversation about ethics in data collection, use, disclosure, who has agency over it, and how it’s shared for personal, commercial, political, etc purposes. It further invites exploration of what kinds of policies and practices create the best use and least abuse of QS data. The Quantified Self Report Card provides an opening for this conversation as well as a baseline measure for current privacy and security policies among a range of QS product providers.""*

For context, my goal is to gain weight while maintaining roughly the same body fat percentage. So as long as I can be confident it's not increasing, I'm pretty content :)You should use https://trendweight.com/ . 

For me I'd say it's pretty consistent. I've been measuring since Jan 2013 and things seem to line up. When I gained a bit, body fat went up. When I lost it, it returned to normal. No major weight gains or losses in this time though.

What did you quantify? Are you analyzing the video? Next to that, the video is very messy, because is jumps from one frame to the other.

OP, what do you think about the ethics of taking pictures in ostensibly private places, like change-rooms, and posting those pictures on the internet for all to see and analyze?

Makes me wish [tagmenot](http://tagmenot.info/) would actually ever work.

I liked this. Is this a typical day for you?

A photo is taken every 10 seconds.

I believe that Quantified Self isn't just about 'the data' but also how we capture it. The Narrative Clip 2 is a unique camera and my post was meant to showcase how I used it.

Perhaps you didn't even know this camera existed? Or maybe you did but haven't seen how other people are using it. Either way, I believe this will be useful to someone - and isn't that all that really matters when it comes to sharing in the first place?

I think it belongs here in that it was somewhat recording the self, the first step to quantifying, but it was nauseating as shit and I struggle to see if you could gain any insights from it.


Ooooh. Good question. 

I was in the mens room at one point while wearing this and realized 'oh shit, I'm wearing a camera'. I covered the camera until I was out of the mens room, but it definitely gave me pause and made me realize the passive implications of just essentially wearing a body cam.

That said, I do believe that body cams are going to be the norm, and faster than we think. Privacy is essentially dead, especially in NYC. We now live in a new age of cameras and we need to focus on the positive attributes and how society can be helped instead of how it can be used to monitor. The question is really how people choose to use this stuff.

If every photo ever taken could be sorted in virtual space on a time line, we would have a time machine. Who knows what truths that could uncover.

 

I wish! It was the perfect storm of things we wanted to do and fun errands to run.

To the casual observer I guess this is a big mishmash.

As a personal mini-archive though, I can identify all the key places I went. While I don't anticipate wearing this every day, I could see some utility from having one of these mini-archives for every day and being able to just glance back in time.

> I do believe that body cams are going to be the norm, and faster than we think

Cyberpunk-style goggles could become the norm if people start using them. That does not circumvent the ethical issue. Constantly being monitored by your peers is not a fait accompli at all; how many people have you seen with body-cams? I have seen maybe 5, including you, and including watching videos on QS.

We need to think of the positives and possibilities, sure, but we should also consider the negative consequences so we do not run into the future blind. Just because you do not think of monitoring your peers and instead ""think positive"" does not mean algorithms could use your pictures to gain information on your peers, and with corporations the way they are, those cyberpunk goggles may not be so far off.

What is the big positive here, anyway? You got a little vine of your day? So... how is that great for the world?

I have thought about the negative consequences far more than the positive, and most of them stem from the fact that every corporation wants to have you transmit your data through them before you can get it. **This is the fundamental problem, not the devices.**

Lets take the Narrative Clip 2 I used for example, they have/had a cloud service where ALL your photos are sent for you to view them easily. There is also an option to just dump them on your computer (my preferred choice), but the default was to use their cloud service. So now they are the central repository of a literal photographic timeline for however many customers they have. They state that it offers me 'ease,' but I don't know why they didn't design it to be more individual and less centralized in the first place. If they merely provided the tools for me to view my life they can't take advantage of all the data they don't have. But their service was designed to suck up everyones photos instead of getting people to figure out a good way to utilize and maintain their product.

Fitbit is the same, and why I sold mine. There is no reason that they need my data, but they get it all. Why? I don't know of an 'offline' device that allows me to log my information without me providing my information. It's ass backwards and doesn't appear to be changing. 

As far as what I (could) get from this... a lot. I have 18k+ photos from my life, chronicled by year. Everything from the photos my parents took of me as a kid to the photos I took yesterday. They are all in one place, and occasionally I 'go back in time' to answer a question I don't have the answer to. 

My website (futur3gentleman.com) lists every article of clothing I own and when I purchased it. I have receipts for most of them, but not for some of my really old t-shirts. By 'going back in time' I traced the first photographic evidence of when I was wearing those shirts and had a reasonable idea as to when it was purchased instead of just a guess. To me that is valuable, and not something I planned for when I took a photo of myself 10 years ago.

There is no question that technology - in general - will be used for good and evil. The real question is which side you are on.






> This is the fundamental problem, not the devices.

But you have not circumvented the actual problem. In fact, one might argue that you are using the devices and by tacitly/explicitly accepting of the corporate policies by using the devices makes you complicit in the very problem you have identified. Perhaps the problem is that people are willing to capitulate to corporations too easily.

>As far as what I (could) get from this... a lot.

Well, I started watching your video about your clothes. Seems like you *feel* like you gained a lot, but to my eye, ""All this is just to, like, get your mind thinking"" does not actually sound like there was a lot to gain. It seems like you are just trying to build a brand or something with your charts, infographics, and website/blog. You might get a discount at a place you shop with *product placement* Raise *product placement*?

Did you really not know where you shop? No offence intended, but indexing my wardrobe would be a waste of time because I already know where I like to shop because I shop there... it seems like a no-brainer. I guess I just have a hard time imagining being unaware of what is happening in my life day-to-day. I mean, I do not need to repeat the criticism you already got from posting it on reddit... aaaand your video devolved into reading and reacting to reddit comments, surprised that reddit and MFA did not unanimously love your super-catchy titles. I'm out.

>The real question is which side you are on.

Yeah, but, you did not really address that question. The fact is that you took pictures of everyone in your vicinity without their consent, including in ostensibly private places like change-rooms, and posted those pictures online, so, I guess you are *de facto* on the side of the corporations.

> But you have not circumvented the actual problem

I believe the problem is allowing lots of rich data to become centralized. By choosing products that keep that data on the individual level I believe there is less risk as it would then require more steps to 'big data-ify' it all together.

> Did you really not know where you shop?

Not with the level of detail I have now. Inventorying my wardrobe taught me a lot of things that I lay out in that video and made me think about my wardrobe purchases in a more conscious way. Having done all that work, I have a solid base of 'wardrobe thinking' and next year I will likely come up with even greater conclusions about how I want to interact with my wardrobe.

> The fact is that you took pictures of everyone in your vicinity without their consent, including in ostensibly private places like change-rooms, and posted those pictures online, so, I guess you are de facto on the side of the corporations.

In that moment I think it just makes me an asshole :) It was a mistake I made because I don't wear the clip frequently.

>I believe the problem is allowing lots of rich data to become centralized

Sure, you were able to keep it private in the first place because you did not need to use proprietary software to put it on the company's cloud... but then you uploaded it to the cloud! You posted it to instagram so you made it readily available to Big Data.

>Inventorying my wardrobe taught me a lot of things that I lay out in that video

You learned the average price of your clothing, which is information, but if that information is not guiding some behaviour then what was the point? Are you really going to reconsider spending $25 on a shirt because it is above average? Or $15 because it is below average? Seems like you would be wiser to judge a new shirt purchase the same way you did before doing the inventory. There are so many other metrics, like quality, fabric, or even how much you subjectively like the shirt that are (more?) impactful to your purchasing behaviour than knowing average garment price. Am I wrong?  
I mean, dude, how did you not know what underwear you use? Did you really need to photograph everything you wear to find out your underwear is Calvin Klein? It's not like they were even gifts!

I mean, a lot of what you learnt by going to all the trouble with the pictures and the counting and the Excel spreadsheets could have been handled by an afternoon of rummaging and eye-balling. If you just *look* at all your clothing you should be able to eye-ball that a quarter is black, a quarter is white, a quarter is blue, and the rest is a melange of random colour. That's just not a difficult thing to eye-ball. Honestly, I sort my clothes when I do the laundry so I already have an idea of my colour choices.  

Or the conclusion that the vast majority of your clothes cost $0-100. Of course they do! I can say that about my stuff with very high certainty because we simply need more less expensive items (socks, underwear, shirts) than we do expensive gear (shoes/boots, nice sweaters, jackets/coats). Those ten pairs of socks are going to pull down the average from that single jacket.

I do not want to disparage you for doing a project you are passionate about: if you enjoy it, go for it! Just don't try to justify the idea by the information you gained: if you want that information, you could get it just by taking five or ten minutes of sifting, eyeballing, and thinking a little. The justification for a project like that has got to be the love of exploration and infographics because ballparking could be done way faster and get you the same level of actionable information. Maybe I am just more interested in efficiency than data for data-sake.

I created a spreadsheet tool for tracking your energy levels throughout the day, along with libido and mood, and correlateing that with what you're eating, doing, etc, then showing the results in a graph.  

I've been testing it with a few friends, and in a week or two I plan to start a big study where I have hundreds or thousands of people- redditors, readers of my blog, or whoever's interested- fill it out for at least a week and then submit it to me anonymously. Then after I have at least a few hundred of them, I'll mine the data for insights, with the help of some of the data wizards here on reddit, and share the results and insights with everyone.  

I've refined the sheet a fair amount over the past month, and I could use some feedback on creating the final version that I release to the pubic. Take a look: 
[Numbers version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2UFYjEW_FEGWnIzVnl5RHM4UUE)
[Excel version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2UFYjEW_FEGZXhNTTd2Nno0N1U)

Now I really need advice on how to make this easier to use, and more useful. And specifically:

Are any of the instructions unclear or insufficient?

Do you like how I've defined every value for energy, mood and libido?  

Any other rows or columns I should add or variables I should track? Was thinking of adding one for ounces of water consumed, or a row at the bottom to add up total food/caffeine consumption, but I'm open to other ideas too.

Is there a second chart I could add in addition to the one I have that would be useful?

Does the Excel version display well?  And do I need to create a separate Google Spreadsheet version?  I don't have Excel and have never built one in Google.  

If I collected hundreds of these, could people aggregate them to crunch the data?  Any design changes that would make that easier?

Anything else I could do to make it better- bearing in mind it needs to be accessible to casual users?The spreadsheet looks fine in Excel. But this exercise might be too tedious to get more than a dozen people to complete it, even if it's just a week long.

- Spreadsheets work fine for collecting per-day data (how many hours of sleep, did I exercise today etc), but for anything more fine-grained, general-purpose logging apps (or a combination of specialized apps like [Dailyio](http://daylio.webflow.io/)) work better. 
- Counting calories is tedious and rarely accurate. Consider tracking meal times (along with tags like ""snack"", ""sandwich"", ""coffee"") instead.
- You're leaving out one important piece of context: location (i.e. is the person at home, at work, traveling etc).


That's the best piece of feedback I've gotten so far.  You're right, calorie counting is asking too much if I'm expecting a lot of participants.  

I did suggest mentioning location, but it deserves its own column.  I'll add that in.

Programming an app is way beyond my capabilities.  But you can use spreadsheets in your phone, you just need to download a spreadsheet app.  I need to add that to the instructions.

The only other question that leaves is time- thinking maybe I should move back to one-hour instead of half-hour intervals.

I want something (could be a mobile app or a dedicated device) to track my location permanently. Like what Sport Trackers (Endomondo is the one I used) but not with a focus into sports activity but into location.

This is something I wanted to exist since I was 15 years old when I bought a Garmin Etrex Legend handheld GPS.

I'm 30, not working because I sold my startup and planning to travel to travel with my bicycle around the world.

I'm using Moves but it's far from what I would like, you can't set a really good accuracy and since it was bought by Facebook now the focus is very far away.

I see this question could fitted better in the Lifelogging subreddit but besides it was active in the past, it's pretty much dead right now.

I'm somewhat sure that there's not an app that does what I want and I'm planning on funding the development of an open source one that makes it. There was a company called ARO that made Saga but the went bankrupt and the team is all dispersed.

Any idea, advice or suggestion is appreciated. Expressions of interest in the field are also welcomed.

Thanks for reading Have you used Google Timeline? Built into Maps and does a pretty decent job, maybe not as accurate as you'd like but it collects a lot of data with basically no effort. 

Are you interested in just tracklogs (like the ones you get from apps like Endomondo), or do you also want place names associated with your locations (like you get from Moves)?

Google Timeline is a good option, but isn't more accurate then Moves. It is a bit smarter as it makes use of appointments (if you use Google Calendar) and searches (if you use Google Maps). You can edit not just incorrect locations (like with Moves), but also incorrect begin and end times. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an official way to export all of the data (neither Google Fit nor Google Takeout appear to include place names).

[Smarter Time](http://www.smartertime.com/) could be another option, haven't looked at it much yet.


Have you considered Fog of World, or Strut on iOS? 

Try with Google Latitude or Foursquare

You could buy a GPS people use for their camera

I currently use Life Cycle. It tracks where you are and gives you insights and graphs based on that information. For example last week I worked an hour longer on average. 

It's not exactly perfect but it's still pretty neat. 

Get an android device and visit google.com/locationhistory

I was a big fan of Google Latitude back in 2013 when I used it on my blackberry. It had an acceptable polling rate and offered to download the raw data. Visualizations on Maps (Now Timeline) where good and it even allowed my friends to follow my path in real time. It's sad they discontinued the product and there's no offering for iphone. 

Smarter Time is a good find, thank you!
They are very small as a company and product but looks it could be promising. Iphone app is not ready yet although.

If I have to be truthful about my interests I have to say I would like to have a full feature set like sharing my location permanently, analyze tracks (like sports trackers), get achievements like Foursquare/Swarm, chose medium of transportation (bike, bus, airplane, etc) and get statistics, upload all my tracks (anonymously or not) to the cloud for anyone to see, connect with other social products like flickr, twitter, tumblr, etc..

I love quantification, the product model that Moves came up with of granting authorization with a numeric code to a big pool of apps its clever but it never took off so most of them are dead by now. I imagine many business cases and applications and app like that could have. 

There are a few business cases/uses I would like to use that weren't development yet, related to circumstantial positioning. For example this month there was a fire at a power plant and a fire at a major airport here in the country I live in (Argentina). I would loved to see WHO (even anonymously) been around to the incident to know how really was. Same thing could be applied to sports events, political demonstrations, whatever. The idea of having a public proof of attendance based on a geo-track excites me. What do you think ?

Thank you very much for your reply. I didn't know about them and I see that in some fields they are somehow close to my expectations. One of them lacks the ability to export the tracks but I'm going to give a try to both of them. They look fun. Both are developed by small companies and they are not even close to the engagement Foursquare enjoyed but I'm in the plan of building a business plan around the idea myself so it's good to see how they addressed some issues. Do you currently use any of them ?

It looks very far away from what I would like but I'm going to give it a try. Thank you very much.

You can still download all your raw timeline data; click on the gear and select ""download all my data.""

The polling is sub-minute, as well, at least on my Nexus 6. Probably, it isn't polling constantly, but using the gyroscope to detect when the device is actually being moved versus totally stationary and pings when it's moving.

You can enable location history in the G+ app for iOS, apparently.

I don't know if Moves ever had a business model, other than getting acquired...

Who is your customer?

Government agencies? Most mobile network operators already [keep a record of people's locations](https://www.aclu.org/cell-phone-location-tracking-request-response-cell-phone-company-data-retention-chart). Such data is being used for [urban planning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220109168_Real-Time_Urban_Monitoring_Using_Cell_Phones_A_Case_Study_in_Rome) and of course law enforcement. 

Consumers? Some people might pay for a proof of presence app, but it would have to be a bit more complicated since GPS location can be [spoofed](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Kang-Is-Your-Timespace-Safe-Time-And-Position-Spoofing-Opensourcely-wp.pdf) or simply [mocked](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2531317/android-mock-location-on-device). Swarm and Facebook both let you tag friends when doing a check-in, which seems like a much simpler solution (if you can establish a chain of trust).


Sorry for the late response. I use both, but more Fog of ~~Workd~~ World than Strut. I started out with Fog of World over two years ago, and the app was just updated last year after a very long time. I also beta tested. 

I started using Strut because there was a lack of updates to Fog of World at the time. 

Fog of World has the ability to import GPX files so if you use something to track something in particular (like the Trails app) you can bring it in later. 

I'm thinking on a just-for-fun app that some niches of people would love to use. 

Lifeloggers, geocachers, quantifiers, travelers, etc.

I don't use Waze because I don't drive, but I've heard that it has a ranking of km traveled and people like to share with friends and get achievements. Also foursquare was a big boom back then.

I think that the difficult monetization model is one of the reasons why an app like that doesn't exist yet. Being the app just for fun allows some features to exist that can't exist in a for-profit model. For example storing the logged tracks locally and not sending them to any server. The app could operate totally standalone, not fetching shops/landmarks Information or anything. 


I'm what it comes to GPS spoofing I have several ideas. The most critical is the ability to allow the community to analyze and scrutinize your track. If you won all the achievements and it looks fishy, the community can dispute your record and vote if it looks true. Creating a fake track that looks like a real track is between difficult and impossible. Something similar to create a fake Facebook profile without getting catch. 

I'm thankful for your time and appreciate the ideas challenging.

I've been using them heavily since you mentioned them 48 hours ago and I have mixed emotions. They are both good products in the sense that they don't suck. But they see little use. The whole user experience isn't exciting or engaging so even after years of release, they failed to create critical mass. I'm already on the leaderboard with my daily commute. 

In my ideal app there would have to be profiles to connect with other trackers/players, real funny and interesting badges (not just you travelled miles and similar mechanics), time-trail challenges, analyzing tools, comparisons, groups of friends, real time location sharing, track editing (for places you have been) and more.

Would you like to alpha test it if I decide to start?

Hey, apologies for a late response. Keep me posted on your progress? Depending on how things are on my end when you're ready to alpha test, I might be able too. Things are a little hectic now, but doesn't mean I'm not interested. 

I've been using Struts for the past 30 days (unlocked 34 tiles mostly because of some flights around the US) and while I had fun and liked it, it's very underachieving. It could be 10 times better. Tracking on airplane mode works half of the times, the syncing is slow, the medals aren't interesting (just countries, states, continents...) and the ""competition"" isn't that fun. It takes too much time to load the rankings and scores and lacks lots of features that could be use to engage users.

I don't think my app is going to be ready for alpha in this coming months but thanks for your support. Of course I will keep you posted. I'm planning to start a new small (two thousand dollar development) proof of concept to test some ideas I have in my mind.

There is a lack of ""doing more than just uncovering"" in these apps. As mentioned previously, I'm more into Fog of World than Strut, but I still keep an eye on both. Thinking about maybe running Strut on one phone and FoW on my main. 

As for social-ness in the upcoming app, naturally that's your choice. It seems to be the popular choice, I'm just burnt out on everything needing some kind of social network attachment. What happened to just doing things for personal satisfaction? Seems like it's the norm to do anything (like take photos or videos) not for personal curation or documentation, but just for sharing (instagram, Facebook etc)

Anyway. Too much ranting. Tracking flights is a hit or miss, I've noticed this too, in FoW but it's main the fault of the built in gps which isn't super powerful compared to say, a Bad Elf. Helps if you're next to the window too. Metal tube and all.

I have a visual representation or graph of several different ways to classify and group emotions if you are interested?

I also had previously looked into different emotion classifications etc.

I had looked to do a desktop app but happy to chat and share my concepts as I just wanted the tool for my own tracking. 

I had thought of using the inkblot tests  to capture key words of what you see, get that later analysed by psychology students eg if feeling classification is ""angry"" and inkblot they see ""skull"" seems to give a different view and understanding.

The other trick the psychologist I spoke with suggested was just to use a free form / one word response to ""what emotion are you currently feeling"". 

P.s. when is the android port happening? 

Tracking different aspects is definitely useful. The only question I have is how independent they are. I can't imagine a time when I would be both high in tiredness and in energy.

Nice! What statistical methods do you use for the correlations? Have you found any (non-obvious) correlations in your own data?

The mindset I had when designing the tracking style was to focus on the relationships and correlations between the 6 aspects of mood. So you're absolutely right! As tiredness goes up, energy will most likely drop in return. The reason for both of these specifically is that tiredness refers how you feel mentally, while energy is focused on how your body feels.

Something like a fitbit with heart rate monitoring that constantly syncs with a phone via Bluetooth may be an option. If tracking remotely, the device syncs with an app in a phone, which then can sync with an account in the Web, which could be read remotely I guess.

I have seen many folks that used QM before, but have not seen any discussion recently about it.

I have a blog on it also:
http://myquantifiedbrain.com/

Drop me a line for any questions, etc.

I plan to use it myself in the future. So no experience yet.

But I'm curios about your cognitive performance experiment with the biohack technique. What is it about?

Are you going to be able to distinguish learning the tests from the effect you're trying to generate in your testing? If it's a single subject, unless it's possible to do an A-B-A-B design, you'll probably just see that you got better at the tasks the more you do them.

Here is the url to the Quantified Mind website
http://www.quantified-mind.com/

jdpl28, interesting blog entries; enjoyed reading them. Also, a good talk; esp. interested in quality of sleep and cognitive performance.

Thanks for sharing.

How did you account for building skills through repetition.  QM's site mentions that the tests are built that they repetition skills quickly plateau.  How did you find the tests were for you?

Hey quantifiedz,

I'll be curios about your experiment when you do it... plz do share.

I am going to do a stillness meditation hack that creates mind-body coherence.  It helps me create powerful and focused days; I now want to see the impact on cognitive performance like executive functions, memory, etc.

What will you be experimenting on?

Yeah, that's definitely a question mark for me, too.  I gather from what I heard others have said, these tests are not designed to improve your cognitive function, just to measure them.

I also will measure my baseline (testing without doing the hack) over a 7-10 day period.  That will help to establish the inherent improvement as a result of practice.

Lastly, I plan to distinguish days I do the hack from days that I do not.  Maybe 10 days of baseline, 10 days of hack, and 10 days of no hack.

What do you think?

I found my scores going up throughout - mind you much more slowly to the end.

But - I was also doing a load of 'brain hacking' experiments. New supplements, changing diet, etc. 

Very hard to tell with n=1 what exactly was happening. Anecdotally I felt I was learning to do the tests better as time went on. Also was finding ways to keep more focused through the test - making sure I was in better environments, etc.

How did you log this data? Was it in excel directly or do you have an app that reminds you every day?


Interesting question!

The most consistent day was Friday at 0.9; the most inconsistent day was Monday at 1.37.

Most interesting sleep thing learned: thc consumption = no dreams. 

Right now I'm building a database of the costs associated with ingredients that I use in recipes, so I can calculate the cost-per-serving of each recipe and possibly reduce my cost of living (by identifying expensive ingredients that I can get cheaper elsewhere, or expensive recipes that I can cook less often). For example, a taco recipe that I use costs $4.39 per serving, whereas a lentil curry recipe costs $1.64 per serving.

I am wondering how you guys are quantifying and analyzing all of this information. What insights have you been able to get out of them? I am trying to get more energy but I am not sure how to get that out of the data I got from my FitBit, sleep tracker and scale. I want to correlate my energy with some of the inputs from the above.

It's called Nomie 

/r/nomie or https://nomie.io

I have been using Journaly to track caffeine intake and mood 

Initially I was using Excel formulae. For example, a package of ~6 small onions costs $1.50, so I put 1.50/6 in one cell to reflect the cost-per-onion. I do this for onions, garlic, lentils, etc... 

In another cell I sum the cost of the ingredients, and then divide by the number of servings the recipe makes. For example, the recipe calls for 2 small onions, so I add the onion cell (multiplied by 2, because it's per-onion) to the recipe total. The recipe makes 6 servings, so in the end I divide the total by 6 to get a cost-per-serving.

I noticed my receipts from the grocery store give me all the information I need to calculate costs. Even when I buy things that aren't in bulk, the package tells me how many grams, or ml, or whatever it is. And you can find conversions online pretty easily. I Googled ""how many ml per tbsp of oil"" or ""how many grams of dry beans are in a cup"". So when a recipe calls for 4 tbsp of oil, but the oil is sold by the litre, I just convert it.

I'm pretty good with PHP programming, so I'm using that now (defining variables for each ingredient), but it's all do-able in Excel. What kind of things are you trying to quantify every day?

Edit: HealthKit is coming in the next next release. 

Actually I installed but when I understand it right it only counts e.g. cups of coffee or beer without tracking the caffein or alcohol content. 

Since you have the HealthKit requirement  - Nomie should, most likely, be disqualified. 

But, you could create your own tracker - e.g.  a number tracker called Caffeine, with the Unit of Measure set to mg (or whatever format it would be). 

For the caffein I don't want to remember the mg in every drink. Instead just say I drank e.g. a small coffee. I have an caffein tracker that does this, plus a water tracker and there are alcohol trackers that know the alcohol content of drinks. I just thought there should be a unified app, because the input is always just a drink and an amount.

I'm xposting this from /r/Diabetes, and it's targeted at any T1 diabetic individuals here at /r/QuantifiedSelf.

I've got a weird request. I'm a masters student, and I'm focusing on machine learning and data mining in my final semester and I want to do a cool project regarding T1DM.

I would like to try and create a model that predicts blood sugar for one particular patient using as much blood glucose, insulin, carbohydrate and maybe exercise data as I can get from them. This has been tried before with varying degrees of accuracy, but I think they've made some mistakes and that it could be done better.

I'm asking the internet because this isn't with grant money or anything, or for a thesis. It's just a class project, and it would be completely anonymous and unpublished - just to see if it can be done and get some practice and try a few things that I think previous attempts missed or did poorly. The data I'm picturing is hard to find online and I think it would be more interesting if it was genuine and not some random overused set from UCI in 1994.

Then, if that model's error isn't massive, I would build a few visualizations of it, possibly interactive, which I could share with whomever shared their (depersonalized) data with me. (with the large caveat that it is just for fun and can not be used clinically of course)

So what I am requesting is some tables. Blood glucose readings and times/dates(preferably exact), insulin units, times and type, carbohydrate consumption and times (and maybe other nutrition data) and possibly exercise time/type/duration and potentially calories consumed.

If anyone is very dedicated to keeping records of their data and would be interested in sharing.. pm me and we can talk about ensuring it is depersonalized/anonymous. I would be extremely appreciative. I know pumps and meters keep some of this, I am hoping to meet someone who keeps intricate records, of course, as more data means a better model, though would be happy with a few months of bg/carbs/insulin amounts and times. (and I'm probably restricting it to one person to remove the inter-individual biological variability, though that may change). In return you would have my sincere gratitude and get to see a cool predictive(and hopefully interactive) chart of your data and the model.

Thanks so much for reading!So I actually have researched making a very similar model albeit with different types of software techniques since I'm not too great at python yet... but I would honesty just recommend research the recommended daily intake for all of those things for people with T1, then other data for reading like glucose and insulin in response. theres a wealth of free information about treating diabetes online. then you can start making your own data sets (possibly even randomized) that you can then try to use your algorithm on. I've actually read that same UCI paper you're talking about I think, and while that data has probably been used to shit I doubt you're going to find anything much different from a random person online.

Check out ""Due"" for iOS. It allows for +1, +3 hour and +1 day snoozing. I use it daily. 

Beeminder kind of has that, they call it [zeno polling](http://blog.beeminder.com/zeno/), but it's not a to do app it's a ""reach your goals"" app - but your goal could be to do the survey every day and journal every day, so I think it will be perfect for your use case. 

It has the added bonus of charging you money if you fail to meet your goal.

[Calendar Notification Plus](https://github.com/quarck/CalendarNotification) adds a snooze button to your phone's calendar notifications. You can set it to remind you in an hour or so, or a specific time. It's really customizable, too. I like it.

That's a good feature that I don't think any to do apps have. You might want to suggest it to one of the app makers. I've recently started using Todoist and it seems like they'd be receptive to this feature.

I use a free app called 'Alarmed', on iOS. It has a feature called 'Nag-Me', which makes the alarm repeat until marked done. In the free version, you can set Nag-Me intervals for every minute, every 5 mins, every 15 mins, every 30 mins, every hour, and every day. Their pro upgrade lets you customize it completely, to whatever time period.

You can also set a separate ""actionable snooze"" (15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour, 3 hours, or custom), which, presumably, overrides any Nag-Me's you've set for a single snooze period.

All said, the customizability of this thing is great. I haven't tried ""Due"", but I got everything I needed from ""Alarmed"", and didn't feel like I needed to spend the $5 for ""Due"".

+2 this app and works really well on Apple Watch to annoy you until something gets done.

Currently I'm trying to workout how best to store activities like went for a run, visited a webpage, had a coffee, etc. Most other apps are fitness centric so they are only concerned with physical activities. My thoughts so far are to have multiple types of activities. Physical activity (running, walking, still), Digital activity (Netflix, Facebook, website), and maybe Biological events (slept, digested coffee, pooped).

I'm wondering how other people have solved this problem and your thoughts on this particular problem.I think one of the easiest solutions would be to use a logging solution connected to elastic search and visualization as in the ELK stack (elastic search, logstash, kibana). Would be interesting to find someone who tried this already. I have so many data sources I need to integrate, and I have no idea where to start. Probably I would have a background job that both passively waits for pushed events by APIs/RSS/etc. and actively pulls for non-pushed events, to keep the database permanently up to date. Writing the results to logfiles, logstash would take care of forwarding, storing and zipping of the logfiles. Elastic search lets you search for anything you want throughout the complete database you have. And Kibana is great for making dashboards with visualizations or monitors for real time observing.
Displaying the stuff in an app is the easiest part, I guess.

Have you tried the nomie app? On both iOS and android. Free, data is private and does everything you mentioned! [check it out ](http://nomie.io)

Your best bet might be using a general-purpose time-series database, see e.g. the data model used on zenobase.com.

Plenty of options for passively tracking physical activity. Other options for tracking digital activity: RescueTime, Trakt, Last.fm. Netflix no longer allows access to the history API.

Wow, Gibson Research Corporation! There's a name I haven't heard in a long, long time.

None of those actually measure your brainwaves. Look up what the Zeo was and you'll see why those are all poor replacements.

How do you read brain waves from the wrist? 

Sounds like an incredible product and is a terrible loss. I couldn't find anything similar but hope someone creates an equivalent product.

I think they were one of those items that were genuinely ahead of their time.

Very true! It is unbelievable what kind of analytics it looks like they were able to collect. Plus the precision was off the charts. It is sad how so many great products are lost because they were too innovative for the market. This is why I try to invest in as many quantified self tools as I can to keep the trend and development going.

The real point of QS is to not do QS - or at least much less actively. It's similar to the exercise of meditation by monks and those types of guys back in the day. The more you see your biofeedback loop reaction function, the more you understand your input/output dynamics, the more intuitive your life optimization decisions become. Short term, why do people stop using their wrist bands as much? They realize they don't walk enough every day, so they can pretty much check that box mentally without having to look at the data. The trick is to set the QS whole body optimization target/goals very, very high, so that it will take a lot of time and practice to get there, and once you're there, you're ridiculously I tune with the proper functioning of your body. 

I think that's a target worth aiming for - better than posting steps on Facebook.
The short answer is that once you've reached goals, continue to monitor them so they don't regress.

There's all kinds of data in our lives that is interesting.  I still have apps running that track my commute time.  I spent a weeks trying different routes and different times to find the best way to work... but when I went back a year later and graphed it, I saw inflection points where it started getting worse and discovered I need to redo my tests.

Changing heart rate is normal.

If your heart stops you'd be on the floor and people will notice that. 

What you need is something that can Actually warn people before your heart completely stops. You  need a continuous ekg. I don't really think that exists for consumer level market. 

The problem with such a device is that most alerts are going to be false positives (especially if false negatives = law suites or bad press). This isn't a big deal if you are in an ICU with staff nearby 24/7, but could be costly (and stressful) in any other setup. 

https://ifttt.com/channels/withings/triggers/1163621333-pulse-new-heart-rate-measurement

That's the idea behind [ibeat](http://www.ibeat.com), which hasn't been launched yet (although they raised a few million dollars, and supposedly are going to do a kickstarter later this year).  It's a bunch of former Practice Fusion folks, so it'll be interesting to see how they execute on hardware instead of software.

It's an interesting idea, and definitely something that seems like it should exist.  However, I'm really curious how this would actually work.  When your heart stops beating, the device has to recognize it, transmit the information to somebody who then should make sure that it's not a false positive, which then needs to transmit it to a local 911 dispatch, which then needs to get an ambulance to you.  Once they arrive, they need to find you (which, at this point, you're passed out somewhere in your house, so the EMTs will need police there to break down your door).  All of this needs to happen within 10 minutes, or else you'll have some pretty serious, irreversible brain damage (and, you need to have a shockable rhythm, and not just asystole).

I think it'd be more compelling to work on having greater access to AEDs.  Maybe someday we'll all wear undershirts which can defib us if something bad happens.

I think the [HealthPatch](http://www.vitalconnect.com/healthpatch-md) by Vital Connect might do that, however you need a participating medical doctor to get it. 

I feel like it would be pretty easy to get confirmation from the user. The wearable could beep and if the user is still conscious they could press a button to be like ""I'm good fam don't call an ambulance""

Yeah, the problem with that is that the Pulse only has manual heart rate measurement, i.e. you have to tell it you want to take a measurement by pushing the button and then put your finger on the sensor.  It doesn't measure automatically at regular intervals. Where can I get something that will alert people if my heart stops beating?

I am thinking to start collecting data in order to understand and fight my allergies better. 

Most of threads here and resources I find seem to deal with data collection. However, in my case the problem is not data collection, but data analysis. In particular, at the moment I struggle to choose software which could help me to generate and test hypotheses from the data (I don't want to do it by hand = with excel). Is there a specialized piece of software that would do that? Or should I go for the general and complex tools like R?

Thanks!Take a look at learning Python, from what I understand it's not as powerful as R but it might give you the tools needed.

I don't think there is some software that you can just throw data and ask it ""what does this* data tell me?"".

Data analysis tools are usually embedded in languages such as python and R. You would need to learn the basics of one of these and play around looking for something interesting.

I'd just use excel until you are sure what the long term, steady state output of the analysis will be, at which point you can write the code and give it a nice UI.

I want to add to this content and turn it into an article (or maybe a series of articles). Plus, I'm fascinated by this topic and I love good stories :)

I'm looking for stories about people who have had very unique experiences with quantified self projects. 

Suggestions?I really like your question! 

Since I started QSing I have had a number of realizations that repeatedly show me how much control I have over my Self, and how little my data contains me. Think about how contradictory this is: in my vain effort to distill my Self into data, I repeatedly discover how it doesn't contain me.

Today was a good example. 

Every morning I wake up and log some 200 different data points about myself. That feeds into a live dashboard that today told me I was going to have a shitty workout because I've only averaged 5.5 hours of sleep over the last three days and I had too much alcohol the day before. I dragged myself to the gym and, sure enough, I have 3 extra pounds of water weight and I'm dehydrated at the same time. My first lift was much harder than it should have been so I aborted (take the rest day and come back tomorrow). I unloaded the weights and went to go cardio. But then I got pissed at myself. I turned around loaded the weights back up and just pushed. I got a max today. My data was meaningless, I broke through it.

But here's where we start hitting philosophical ore. Why did I turn around and go back? Because I wanted to log better results for myself tomorrow. So the act of creating a Self-container gave me something to reach beyond, quantifying myself made my Self unquantifiable.

I think a lot of people QS to gain some type of control over their lives. I love that contradiction, they want to undata themselves by turning themselves into data. 

Anyway, I don't really like that term the ""data selfie"". It's too superficial for what I think I do.

2 - How often, and in which situations, do you currently check your activity levels?
3 - Do you feel your tracker motivates you to walk? If so, in which particular situations?1. Fitbit Charge HR
2. Via fitbit I track sleep and daily steps. Via runtastic I track runs. There is some overlap.
3. Yes definitely, especially when a friend ""challenges"" me via the app.

2- I check every single time I check the time, so probably 15 times an hour 

3-Absolutely! Wanting to hit my daily fitness goals is a huge motivation. I would say that anytime I check my day's activity and it isn't on par with my expectations, as well as when I receive the hourly stand notifications, which help a lot too.

Almost all of this goes from whatever app was used into a master Excel spreadsheet, with the following worksheets:

- **Fitness Plan**: Calendar type view to plan out workouts by weeks, looking a one large-scale cycle (I have been trying some periodization around specific events or goals). Includes a tracking widget that totals up workout stats to show me if I'm meeting my goals or on track for my goals).
- **Daily Observations**: One row per day. Captures almost all of the data above (for health & meditation categories) and summarizes the daily workout information.
- **Workouts**: One row per workout (may be multiple per day). Captures all the workout data above. 
- **Weekly Summaries**: One row per week. Summarizes weekly data, calculates TDEE, calculates macros for week ahead. That part is roughly based on the r/ketogains calculator. 
- **Charts**: Three large charts. One shows my HRV data including ""boundary lines"" for ""smallest worthwhile change"", the rolling 7 day HRV mean, and the mean covariance. A lot of this is from [Andrew Flatt's blog](http://hrvtraining.com) and some podcast episodes he's done. For me, covariance roughly equates to overall fitness level. The 7 day mean HRV trends with overall recovery level. This, for me, roughly equals total recovery (sleep, good nutrition, enough food, etc) - lifestyle stress (mental, work-related, relationship-related, alcohol, etc) - physical training. If the HRV trend is going up, I have fuel in the tank to train heavy. If the HRV trend is going down, particularly if goes past the smallest worthwhile change boundary line, then I know I need to increase recovery and perhaps decrease training intensity. This has worked very well for me to guide my training loads and plans. Second chart shows training load over time, on same time scale as HRV chart. Useful for comparing training load and HRV and seeing correlations. Third chart shows 7-day mean weight (smooths out the day-to-day inconsistencies), 7-day mean caloric intake, and daily macronutrient ratios. Again, useful to see correlations. Same time scale as above two charts, to make comparisons easier.
- **General planning**: Scattered, loosely organized worksheet with notes and plans for future goals and training cycles. For instance, currently looking at training for a 10 km race later this fall so it has scattered notes relating to that training plan.

I would love to get a Garmin Fenix 3, which would simplify some of the tracking. Data would probably still end up in this excel spreadsheet; I live in Excel for a significant portion of my professional life (relating to quality management, which includes data collection and data analysis), so I'm pretty fond of using it to collect and analyze my own data. And Excel is extremely portable—I can access my spreadsheet from my phone, my iPad, my work computer, and my laptop.

These are the metrics I track and how I track them. 
What do you track? What tools do you recommend?

That sounds like a monster of an Excel file! 
I'd love to take a look at your setup, if you don't mind, of course. 

And the Garmin Fenix 3 is awesome. It's not perfect (mainly slight inaccuracies with GPS), but it's one hell of a watch.

I'm attempting to correlate diet, activities, and supplements with my mood. I need an app for Android that will help me trck mood at regular intervals with CSV or other open export format. Ideally I could get a notification every hour that would prompt me for my mood and then exit. Are you using such an app?
Thanks!Maybe Nomie would work for you! https://nomie.io or /r/nomie 

Nomie was mentioned (by the dev of the app).  I use it and it would do everything you listed. Both reminders and csv export are built in and essentially frictionless.

Another app that comes close and may be more specific is Emotionsense.  It's tied to a research project and is of very high quality.  You can't set it up to remind you at specific times, but it has built in reminders and you control the max per day and stop/start times.

This instigated me to download Nomie. Wow, very beautiful UI and concept. 

I'm using Google Now to remind me to use Nomie to record my mood. +1 Nomie.

It has some flaws, but yeah it's mostly what I'm looking for.

What are the flaws your seeing? 


Most significantly, I've had issues trying to enter retrospective data, eg for yesterday. Also the charts can be difficult to navigate. I didn't realize until today that I could do hourly reminders, but it's been over an hour since I set it and it hasn't popped up...

Multiple reminders are still hit or miss. I've found that one reminder works pretty well. Honestly, I'm gutting the whole reminder system and replacing it with a cloud system.  

As for adding data to yesterday,  you have two methods: 

1. **Best for single edits**: tap the tracker to record, then press and hold and select ""adjust last"" - adjust the day.
2. **Best for multiple edits**: track all the things, then select the clock tab. Select each of the items you want to adjust, then select ""adjust"" in the header. 

Thanks for mentioning it, and bringing up these usability issues. 

I didn't realize I could edit things in the clock tab. That works, thanks! The ""adjust last"" doesn't seem to work if the ""last"" is yesterday, even if it was only just entered (and adjusted to be yesterday). Hourly mood tracking on Android?

> Changes in mood that occur normally in daily life are widely believed to affect the function of other psychological faculties – in particular, the one of cognitive ability. Only 5 previous studies tested this theory using a micro-longitudinal study design, which sees participants repeatedly assessed on mood and cognitive function over the course of several days or weeks. Unfortunately, the studies' findings are inconsistent and inconclusive, mainly because they assessed small samples on few occasions in controlled (i.e. lab-based) settings.
> 
> To address this issue, the smart-phone application moo-Q was developed, which allows repeatedly assessing large samples on mood and cognitive function in natural settings (i.e. experience-sampling method). moo-Q is freely available for download from the Apple store. It prompts users at random times during the day to complete brief measures of positive and negative affect, as well as three quick cognitive tests of processing speed, working memory and short-term memory. All measures were validated in preliminary lab-based studies.
> 
> Since its launch in August 2015 until January 2016, moo-Q was downloaded 24,158 times in 155 countries across the world. 69% of the sample identified as male. Reported ages ranged from 18 to 118 (mean = 31.44 years, SD = 10.10). 15,182 people completed moo-Q once, and 704 people completed moo-Q ten or more times. Latent class growth analysis could not detect systematic group-level heterogeneity in mood and cognitive function over the course of a day (e.g. morning/evening types). Also, neglidible coupling effects between changes in mood and changes in cognitive function were identified.
> 
> The results suggest that changes in mood that occur normally in daily life do not notably alter cognitive function, confirming the stability of inter- and intra-individual differences in cognitive performance. Furthermore, the study illustrates the utility and limitations of smartphone applications for collecting complex trait data on cognitive ability from extremely large samples across countries

Thanks.
This! Am I wrong in assuming we all want this? I'm counting myself lucky I can just almost manager to get most of my data into a CSV format (except for you misfit, let me export my activity!) 

Right now, the best I have seen in terms of storing data is backups to Google docs, and attempting to do analysis with Zenobase, tabuleau public, or maybe Exist.io. I have tried the first two and feel a background in data analytics may be required to make your personal data useful. 

I think I will give ConnectorDB try. Just need to build little linux server - don't like storing my personal data in cloud.

Google Sheets + Forms - for manual data entry are great, if you know how to use spreadsheets for data analysis. But personal data in cloud sucks.....

Excel would be great if it would have good forms to enter data quickly......

I am currently working on getting plotting working for ConnectorDB, but if there is interest, I can certainly check what it would take to make ConnectorDB cross-platform. When initially writing it, I had it working on Windows, but the database setup procedure was easier to do linux-only.

Another issue would be the additional code burden in the android app - it would have to only sync when connected to your home wifi network instead of assuming that it can sync over the internet.

If you're willing to help out in testing/documenting, I'd see if I could get a windows version of the base server by the end of the month.

Ideally this would be one wearable but it seems that most wearables that measure sleep can't measure HRV reliably due to motion artifacts (see eg: https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-wristband-activity-tracker-that-tracks-HRV-reliably-enough).

My research is taking me in the direction of the Polar M400 (for sleep tracking)+ Polar H7 band (for continuous HRV) as it probably makes most sense to be operating within one ecosystem for data handling but I have some doubts over the quality of the M400's sleep tracking.

Would be great to hear from others if you have any experience or recommendations here?If by sleep tracking you mean the tracking of sleep quality based on body movement, then there are everything from cheap apps like ""Sleep Cycle"" on Android or ""24/7 MotionX"" on iOS to a wrist device like a Fitbit or Garmin Vivosmart to a more expensive system like the Beddit. The quality and type of measurements that all of these devices produce vary widely, and I would recommend starting on the cheapest end and working your way up as needed.

For HRV, in preliminary tests a team at the University of California found an almost 1:1 correlation between the R-R intervals reported via [Elite HRV](http://www.elitehrv.com) from a Polar H7 as reported simultaneously by a full EKG.

In preparation for the sleep study they are going to run, they compared two setups: Polar H7 straps in conjunction with a Polar wrist watch to receive the R-R intervals, and Polar H7 straps in conjunction with [the app](http://www.elitehrv.com/app). The results showed a more reliable connection over a longer period of time with [the app](http://www.elitehrv.com/app).

At the time of this posting, they are preparing to roll out Elite to track HRV in the sleep study.

The **main** concern with all of this is the artifacts and signal quality when measuring HRV while sleeping. If you roll around and create all sorts of noise on the chest strap, there is almost nothing a piece of software can do to clean that noise out without eliminating the usefulness of the data for calculating meaningful HRV.

Short of getting an implant, this noise issue is not avoidable with currently available hardware. You can use the intra-reading chart within Elite to see when you tossed, turned or moved enough to cause significant noise in the signal. The periods that are smoother can be used to determine the state of your heart rate and heart rate variability at various points throughout the night.

People may argue that you never know how data that you collect will relate to your life, but if you don't have a passionate question that you want your data to answer, you have no motivation to collect the data routinely anyway=>making it even harder to draw insights from data with gaps in it. 
Even if you have enough day to day data to draw insights from, and if that data draws strong correlation between topics that interest you, you have a ton of work ahead of you as you design controlled variable experiments to confirm causal relationships. 
Again, you need passion and purpose to pursue this level of self discipline. 
Last word of advice: be careful not to mess yourself up with self experimentation if you do find your passion. Educate yourself, seek out professional advice in your topic of interest, work with a doctor to monitor your health. 
Good luck

Thanks for the insight

What also helps is making it as easy (or automatic) as possible.

I want to log my mood every day. So instead of forcing me to remember it and open a Google Spreadsheet, I just programmed my Android phone to ask me for my mood at 8pm. 

It pops up a list of options, I click, it's done.

What tools and methods should I be using?[This](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/133155/how-to-use-pearson-correlation-correctly-with-time-series) might help you.

I would suggest regressions or a structural equation model. Think of what correlations you think are possible, either within each day or from the previous day. Something like this:

    Sleep ~ Caffeine_previous_day + Alcohol_previous_day + Exercise_previous_day
    Mood ~ Sleep + Caffeine + Exercise
    Productivity ~ Mood + Sleep + Exercise + Caffeine

(If sleep or mood or productivity is defined by multiple variables, then you can treat them as latent variables, in which case, in lavaan syntax, you would be fitting a model more like `Productivity =~ Measure1 + Measure2 +...; Productivity ~ Mood + Sleep + Exercise + Caffeine` etc.)

If you find worrisome coefficient estimates like alcohol or caffeine predicting worse sleep, you could then start some self-experiments randomizing them.

Checkout Zenobase.com. It will automatically sync and analyze your data, and show you any trends you want. It is incredible.

I'll be honest, my formal statistics education is still a bit lacking (pending a course I'll be taking in a few months), so that was a little tough to follow. I'm still not entirely sure how I would implement the Pearson correlation coefficient. Would I just work in the excel spreadsheets using the supplied functions, or would I need to fire up something like R? 

Yeah, I used Wizard stats to try and make some models along those lines, but sleep (predicted by alcohol + caffeine + steps walked) was the only one it could produce. I think the main issue is that I've compiled data points from about 5 different apps and it's just not working all that well. I think I'll potentially end up creating a mySQL database for all my data and build a thorough schema that I can query very specifically. I was just hoping for something easier than that for my mid-year analysis. Anyway, thanks for the feedback :)

> Yeah, I used Wizard stats to try and make some models along those lines, but sleep (predicted by alcohol + caffeine + steps walked) was the only one it could produce.

Maybe that's because there's no signal there? This is something I've found so far in my 6-year 100-variable SEM: these environmental things we think are important don't really seem to be.

I'm open to an android or web based solution, I can pay a bit but not lots. Any ideas?

You can import data from these apps into [Zenobase](https://Zenobase.com), where you can combine it with data from automatic sources like Fitbit or RescueTime, do basic filtering, correlations and comparisons, and re-export the data for further analysis or visualization in e.g. R or Tableau.

It basically puts together data from your devices, such as your laptop and phone into one large dataset, on which machine learning can be done.

Looks cool man. What's the plan as far as integrations, future features etc?

I am not planning on adding integrations yet. They're easy enough to add (like... 5 lines of python easy), but no matter how many integrations something has, they are useless if the data is not being used.

The main focus in the near future is basic visualization, and in the mid-to-long term is active analysis.

There's the simple things, such as showing you exactly what amount of exercise makes you most productive, or even just showing what parts of life make you most happy. These would fall under basic visualization.

In the long term the goal is integrating this with an AI which would actively try to make your life better. If integrated with your thermostat, for example, it would automatically try different temperatures in your house, seeing what affect they have on your mood (all while keeping costs in mind). It would try to give you suggestions, and help you experiment with switching stuff around in your life. This is the most difficult task (an AI that has real agency does not exist yet), but my phd research is going roughly in that direction (it is actually pretty hard to figure out what interventions might work in real data).

At this point, I'm gathering the data needed to jump-start the machine learning, since it would need several months (tens of thousands of datapoints) to gain any real insight.

I might also offer a hosted solution, but that is contingent on seeing this actually make a positive impact in my life. It is not at all obvious that real insight will be forthcoming from such data.

Can I install it on windows?

You can certainly install the data gathering app on Windows, but the platform itself is built to be run on a linux server. 

If your goal is to gather data from your windows laptop or desktop, I highly recommend selfspy.

Connectordb is meant to integrate data from multiple sources and to perform processing in the background (it can get very cpu intensive). If you'd like to install connectordb, I recommend running a digitalocean droplet - that will allow your android device to connect to it directly even when you're away from your home network.

Later this year I will set up a public server, since setting up connectordb is a bit of a technical ordeal - but it needs the aforementioned machine learning and analysis modules working before it is truly useful.

As of July 8, windows support is complete :D

It will take a few days for release (still have a few little things to fix), but ConnectorDB 0.3.0a2 can be run on windows. 

Yeah, I will use DigitalOcean.Will 10/month plan have enough power to run ConnectorDB?

Wow that's great! Now i won't need to store my data somewhere else! :D

Even a 5 dollar droplet has more than enough power!

After being frustrated with how difficult it can be to get your own medical data, and how confusing the results are, including countless stories of misdiagnosis, we've been piloting a service to help patients get all of their medical data, from all their doctors, as easily & intuitively as possible. We've been running the service for a small group of paying customers, but now we've dropped out price to free for a limited time being to start helping more people get their data for free: https://checkapollo.com

We believe that everyone should be an active, educated participant in their own healthcare. When it comes to Quantified Self, it seems to us like it's strange that we have our Photos, Location, Financial Data & Wearables data on our phone, but out core health information is so hard to access.

If we can communicate to providers & insurers that people want to have access to their data, that they want to be engaged, then they'll start to listen & engage their patients actively as well. We'd love to hear from the community whether this service is helpful to you & what you want to be able to understand about the data / in which ways you want to use it. One of our big assumptions is that people want to connect with others who are experiencing similar ailments to be able to discuss the data of their lab results in an easy way online. The ability to automatically get a second opinion from another doctor, the community, or a digital diagnosis tool, seems promising.

Please sign up and let's start communicating to the industry that the demand for this type of service is here. Let us know your thoughts on what would be useful and how we can help. I'm hoping that this doesn't come off as promotional, as our aim is to engage the community to understand if this service we're providing is useful & how we can make it most helpful to you.
** I should add that we also collect all your insurance claims on your behalf as well, so you can figure out what your bills actually say!This is amazing. I have been spending weeks on getting my own records together and it is a headache. 

Couple questions: 

1: Are you able to gather images? 
2: Do you take paper documents and make them digital? 
3: Do you provide the raw data as well as your normalized data? 

Thanks in advance! 

This is great, I've been wanting something like this for a while!  You say it's free for a limited time. How much will it be when you start charging?

Hey! Thanks for the encouragement & glad to hear it is something that will be helpful to you. It really is a headache to collect your data and hopefully we can make it a lot easier.

Answering your questions:

1. Are we able to gather images?
Yes we are able to gather images. In theory, if a provider has the images electronically they're supposed to send it to us in that format & what that often means is mailing CDs. Sometimes the providers charge large fees for this type of mailing service, so this is something we're still working on figuring out. Our hope is that we can help provide them tools to share that image data more effectively & at lower costs to the end users.

2. We do take paper documents & make them digital where necessary. However, according to the HIPAA laws and the individual's right to access their records, if a provider has the records electronically they're obligated to return it to us in that format. By some accounts 80% of providers are using Electronic Health Records.

3. Yes we provide the raw data as well as the normalized data. Normalizing the data is where most of the work we do comes in. You'll always be able to actually get to the raw records we received as well!

Glad to hear it's something you're interested in too!

**Here's the TLDR on what I wrote below in response:**

It's free now, and for people who sign up in the next while will always be free to download the raw records we receive. 

Sadly, insurers & providers levy charges on individuals and companies requesting access to the data. Depending on how expensive insurers & providers make it for us to get you your data, we may need to charge something that covers those costs in the future (we're learning more and more about what those costs look like in practice). We hope that ancillary services such as telemedicine can help cover the costs of getting you your data.


**More in depth:**

Our long-term hope and ambition is to provide the service free or as close to free as possible. We believe that just the way you can get your bank account data for free, this should long term also be something that's free. People should be engaged, educated & equal partners in their health. Once the data is a format that is useful, we think it opens up new forms of collaboration and innovation in the healthcare space - and that's our ultimate goal.

The provider & insurance system in some cases make it considerably difficult to obtain your data in a useful format (i.e. something that shows the bigger picture, and is in a suitable data format). Things will change overtime, but it's not there yet. We hope to help get it there a little quicker. Beyond requiring entities like us to 'fax' in the requests, which is archaic, providers & insurers also often charge fees for providing you the data, which can be substantial, and go contrary to the [Individuals' Rights under HIPAA] (http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/) to access their data. 

We will do our best to gather and provide as much data for you as we can at the free price point we're charging. In practice, the costs we experience associated with collecting the data may prohibit us from obtaining all of it. For example, in those access guidelines I linked to above it says they're recommended to charge a flat fee of $6.50  for providing you the electronic records (this is a recommendation, not a cap). If some providers try to charge $50 for an imaging scan it'll make it hard to provide that data, but we can at least let you know what the cost is of obtaining it so you can decide how to proceed. We're learning what is being charged in practice across different circumstances, and hope to bring transparency to the process.

As an individual it's hard to make all the phone calls / send all the faxes needed to obtain your data. But, by pooling everyone's requests through a common hub like Apollo, where we’ve built systems to do that automatically, we hope that we can generate a movement that communicates to providers & insurers that a large number of people want their data, and that charging for access to that data, and not facilitating obtaining it in a useful format, is ultimately just detrimental to the system as a whole. Part of what we’re trying to do is effectively DDOS the insurance & provider system with requests for data so they understand people care. With enough people signed up we can hopefully produce real change - so please share the service along to others who you think are interested!

The reason for this is that some forms of cognitive enhancement can increase focus at the expense of creativity.  Does anyone know of an online or offline test that I could use to properly quantify my creativity on a day to day basis?  Thanks!There are tests that try to quantify creativity (e.g. the [Torrance Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrance_Tests_of_Creative_Thinking)), but these may not be practical to use on a daily basis.

Another approach would be to spend a certain amount of time playing music or writing each day, and self-scoring your perceived level of creativity.

You need to define what you mean by creativity in a rigorous way. What behaviors does someone who is ""creative"" exhibit? Then you can measure the behavior rather than trying to quantify a nebulous concept like 'creativity'.

I was looking at it to understand whats going on but I cant really see patterns or correlations. I feel like if I'm not doing anything with the data I collected, whats the point of collecting more? How do I make use of this data? I would suggest a few things. First, looking at quantity. Start tracking how rested you feel in the morning (it could be a scale 1-5, a smiley face, whatever). After you have some data, see the correlation on how much you sleep and how rested you feel in the morning. 

Second step could be what happens before bed and quality of sleep. Could the time you go to bed have an impact? What about dinner/supplements?

I found that measuring sleep in itself was useless, but the quality of sleep (how rested I felt in the mornings) vs other factors (drinking, exercise, supplements, etc)



I would consider comparing it to any calendar data you may have; so seeing if there a certain schedule throws off your sleep. Comparing it to computer usage with RescueTime might be useful as well to see how, if at all, your routine affects your sleep. 


It seems like the take-home message here is that you'll need to relate your sleep data to some kind of outcome that you care about. Feeling refreshed in the morning is good. I would also suggest assessing your energy level in the afternoon or whenever you would normally slow down if you haven't slept.

If you can use your data to rate your sleep quality (amount of time in REM or other stages for example), or if your device does this, you could use sleep quality as your outcome and track the things that affect it (like bed time, drinking, etc. that were suggested already).

One benefit of tracking is that you build a mental model of the norms. You now probably have a pretty good sense of the average amount of sleep you get per night, how much longer it takes to fall asleep when you watch tv in the evening, etc. 

Once you build that model and feel like you understand your sleep habits, continuing to track will have diminishing returns. You are either reconfirming your model or adding nuance. 

If you find that you are content with the quality and quantity of your sleep, then congratulations. You are now much more aware of this aspect of your physiology and are on the right track.

If you would like to make improvements, then the way to make use of this data is to run small experiments to see the impact on your sleep. What is the impact of exercise on sleep quality? Do breathing exercises before bed help you fall asleep faster? Does having honey before bed prevent you from waking up early?

If you start to think about your data this way, it could really stoke your curiosity and make every night an opportunity to learn something new.

Yes, the app asks stars to rate sleep as my alarm rings in the mornings. But its a smart alarm that doesn't ring in REM cycle so I feel normally good when I wake up. I'll try the other things out. Thanks!

So I should be tracking more than 1 thing. Meaning Sleep and ____, so that I compare the two. Is that right?

Would love to hear your experience with other trackers.
* Is there any difference in the vibrations?
* Did one smart alarm gave you a better awakening?

Based on reviews, am comparing Peak vs. UP3 - but *any* brand works. Would love to begin the day with a great sleep & great awakening, anybody else with the same problem?i love the peak, awesome for sleep tracking, but it doesn't have a smart alarm.  the sony smart band 2 i also have (and like) has a smart alarm but the battery life is only two days. 

It's more of a vibration then a sound, it only light because it tends to only wake you if your in light sleep. I'm not sure if it gets more intense if you are Deep sleep to wake you up 

I used up for a long time, buzzes when your are in light sleep around your alarm for better waking up. 

How does the Smart Band 2 vibration alarm work?  

I.e. does it vibrate like a heartbeat like the Peak?

Thanks! :)

Thanks.  Can you describe Jawbone buzzes?

For example, the Peak buzzes in a heart-beat pattern.  It kinda goes from gentle vibrate and increases in intensity.  But no smart alarm.

it will wake you in a lighter stage of sleep, i.e. smart alarm. you set a range of time to wake you (7 - 7.30am) and it will wake you as soon as you enter a lighter stage of sleep (i.e. not deep sleep) in that period.  it vibrates on and off until you snooze it (press button on band briefly) or turn it off (press and hold button on band). it does have two vibration settings. i prefer the light setting, it's matches the calm vibration level of the basis peak. the higher setting is a bit too intense/annoying for me.

&nbsp;

I really want to start keeping track of my life and collecting useful data about myself. I'm trying to decide on a good wearable and at this time I'm considering the **Basis Peak** to be the only wearable that fits my criteria. The only thing that I don't like about it is the interface.

&nbsp;



I need to reliably collect granular data of:

- Resting HR
- My sleep quality/movements

&nbsp;

I also need the watch to be:

- able to connect to external (chest) HR monitors (for when I'm doing HIIT - can't rely on the wrist HRM)
- able to quickly see the output of said external HRM while running (hence needs to be a watch of some kind)
- waterproof to some extent (showering/ shallow water swimming etc)

&nbsp;

I really like the **Garmin fenix3** but it doesn't seem to reliably collect RHR data.
I've also seen the various **fitbit**s but they don't connect to external HRMs and aren't very waterproof.


I would truly appreciate any suggestions. ThanksI have the basis peak and recommend it highly. nothing else does resting heart rate and advanced sleep tracking (delineating rem, light, and deep sleep) as well. Battery life is solid, it's water proof. And the new music controls and manual ability to add exercises really complete it well. 

I have one.  The Microsoft Band is the other one I considered

I didn't like Basis as a company because they broke the promise of an API but since they are now Intel I could justify it to myself

The big features I want are there, the watch is solid and the read outs are easy to read.

Downside is wearing a weird place makes it hard to see with long sleeves, the band can be irritating and the display isn't as flexible as others

Also swimming and roller skating have to be manually added but you can do that with the latest version of the app

The big thing I needed was regular heart rate that is easy to see, it does that.  I want something that will alert me but there wasn't a good option for HR alerts yet, so I went with what was easiest to check

Do you specifically need the 24/7 readings that the Basis does or are you mostly interested in having a device for workouts? Because there are definitely better workout-focused options out there.

I had the Basis B1.  I will never buy another Basis product due to how they handle your data--in that you basically give all of it to them, and pay them for the privilege (in buying the hardware).

As a sleep tracker, the B1 is pretty damn good.  As a heart rate monitor it was OK for day-to-day, but terrible for fitness tracking.

Like I said though, given that you are 100% tied to their platform with their hardware, the second they stop supporting your device it is a paperweight, and all of the data that's been accrued is gone.  IMO that makes the purchase just not worth it.

Edit:  If you're looking for something to track resting heart rate and sleep, it wouldn't hurt to check out the Xiaomi Mi Pulse (1S).  It doesn't have a display of its own, but you get *crazy* long battery life (~1-1.5 months) for the tradeoff.  I found the heart rate tracking on that to be pretty comparable to the Basis B1 when paired with the MiBand Notifier app (on the Play store) because it allows you to set the interval to read the heart rate data, and allows you full access to the data.

The Basis B1 was, in my opinion, better at tracking sleep cycles, however the Mi Band does do a pretty good job of being able to tell you how long you slept for, and doesn't require any manual intervention (ie telling it you're going to sleep).  

That said, the Mi Band is like $20 - $30, so it's really a no-brainer in my mind to at least try out.

I have the Fenix 3 on my left wrist and the Fitbit Charge HR on my right. Kind of ridiculous, but I use the Fenix to track all of my activities with a HR strap, and the Fitbit Charge HR for RHR and 24/7 HR tracking. 

With that said, have you checked out the Fenix 3 HR? It's very pricey, but it does fit all your criteria that you have listed. 

That said, the sleep data from my Fenix is sort of meaningless, so use my Fitbit for that. 

I'm definitely more interested in something that will accurately monitor my HR 24/7 and sleep.



Hmm okay thanks I will keep that in mind.
I'll take a look at the mi band.

Looks like Basis data is exportable though: https://support.mybasis.com/hc/en-us/articles/204142550-Exporting-Your-Data

Also, i learned from a few reviews that the fenix 3 HR's 247 HR and RHR are also meaningless due to the erratic sampling rate. 

Thanks for your response. 

The section on how to convert dates to local time is quite hilarious (and also not quite correct)...

Basis also exports at least some of the data to Google Fit (and HealthKit?).


The heart rate, step, calories, skin temp, and gsr data is exportable, but any of the activity and sleep data is solely contained within the app at this point, but there do appear to be some python and php scripts out there that might work for that.

Sounds like they've changed their tune a bit but still once bitten twice shy and all that.

The activity and sleep exports to Google fit with the Peak

I assume that's only for total sleep though correct?

For example on the sleep cycle app it tells me how my step correlated with sleep quality. I've been messing around with scatter plots in excel.

What do I need to do, learn some statistics?

What I want is a big table where I track loads of metrics, where I can have a drop down menu to see how they affect each other. Like how my heart rate variability effected my sleep etc.

How would I do this?Some knowledge of statistics would definitely help. For online resources, I have heard great things about [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability).

Assuming you are tracking useful metrics, the more consistent you are with tracking and the more data you accumulate over time, the easier it will be to identify patterns. Contextual notes are also very helpful since nothing we do happens in a void. The hard part is contextual notes aren't always easily ""trendable"", but when you do see a pattern they can help explain why it exists.

Another big challenge is aggregating data from different tracking sources into a common format. It will be really difficult to compare data from different apps if you have to do a lot of manual cleaning and formatting to get the data into a common spot for analysis. That part of the process is a little data science and a lot of work.

I'm in the midst of building a tool to do exactly what you are describing. We started with [capturing HRV, sleep and exercise](http://www.elitehrv.com) and are expanding in the next few months to include many more metrics, integrations and an automated but flexible analysis dashboard like the one you describe. (We currently have [one for teams](http://team.elitehrv.com), but are building one for individuals).

Go simple first and then complex over time. Cheers

This is data science territory, and when someone can do this clearly and at scale, they will make alot of money. 

That said, I am actually looking  at using Splunk to do just this. Splunk being a log analysis tool for computer systems, but some of their engineers have written blog posts on using it for quantified self... 

Yes, you need to learn some statistics. Note that ""does x affect y"" is a much harder question than ""are x and y correlated"".

Also, no matter how good your knowledge of statistics is, without understanding the limits of the tracking methods you are using, and without a basic understanding of human physiology, you won't know what questions are meaningful to ask...

Check out [An Introduction To Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). The book is free, R is also free, and there are a tonne of free videos for the book online. It is graduate-level applications of statistics.

Scatter-plots in Excel is a really good start, though, and basically that is going to get you your eye-ball guesses. Without a greater understanding of principles of statistics you are going to be able to come to lots of false-conclusions about spurious correlations, and correlations do not show causation, but what you are doing is a start, and probably the best you can do with a sample-size of one.

If you want to try to tap into causation, time-lag your data. For example, if you went for a run in the morning how did you sleep that evening and the following evening as compared to the evenings on which you did not run. More importantly, try to prove yourself wrong. If you think running improves your sleep, try to show that *not* running improves your sleep, or that running has such a small effect on your sleep that it does not matter. 

To everyone who replied - that's great info thank-you. I don't know if you're on mac, but I found a piece of software called Wizard for statistics. Seems to do a lot the heavy work for me... I still want to get a basis and understand what I'm looking at but I'd encourage you to have a look!

You mean less than what you would have paid at InsideTracker or WellnessFX? It's quite likely that the tests are processed at either LabCorp or Quest regardless of what service/physician you go through.

Apparently my father has some fish oil capsules, Dr. Tobias brand, and they have 960mg of DHA––holy shit. I guess I'll start taking those. BTW they're molecularly distilled and third party tested, so there doesn't seem to be any funny business

The problem is that the quality of supplements can vary highly. Even Omega-3 supplements with high listed amounts of EPA and DHA can be useless if the actual amounts are lower. Check out labdoor.com which does good testing on a variety of brands.

Also check out examine.com for evidence as to dosage.

Flax seed has a lot less EPA and DHA. It's mostly ALA.

You can export to CSV using the mobile app. 

Basis can also send at least some of the data to Google Fit and Apple Health.

Check out Quantified Bob's page - includes scripts to download all data, including sleep data.

Yeah that's what I've been doing so far. The only thing is that it doesn't export the sleep data.

Yeah it does send at least total sleep time and steps throughout the day as well as heart rate when you're actually having it track an activity.

[deleted]

I believe they keep their sleep data proprietary, no one knows what's behind those algorithms 

Yeah I guess a VA is another good option for something like that. How many hours a week does he spend on your data?

Yeah, you can only export HRV, GSR, body temp, and steps (all are per minute averages or counts). I remember seeing people use private APIs - maybe this lets you access sleep data?

I love the app ""moves"" but I want to track more information and improve the accuracy of the measurements. The subjects in question are:

Withings Activité Pop or Steel

Apple Watch (possibly gen. 2) 

I know that each has its own trade-offs, but I was wondering if some of you guys had experience with either of the devices.

Thanks for the help :) 

The Apple Watch isn't well suited for sleep tracking, so you'd have to combine it with another device like the Beddit or Emfit QS. Also, Apple Health data is hard to use outside of Apple's ecosystem.

The Fitbit Charge HR is a decent general-purpose device, as is the Jawbone UP3. Both have good access to the data.

If you don't care about heart rate (or prefer to use a chest strap or a shirt like the Hexoskin to get accurate data during workouts only), the Withings Activité or the Misfit Shine are good options, too. 

Have you considered the Basis Peak? ~4 day battery life, activity tracking (exercise and steps), sleep tracking, calories burned from activity, heart rate, and perspiration. 

You can also get app/text/phone notifications displayed straight to your phone.

Haven't personally used either, but I bought an Apple Watch for my girlfriend. 
It's okay, but as a wearable to track your health data, I thought that it leaves much to be desired. 
The HR tracking is every 10 mins or so, which I feel is not very insightful. 

Why not the Fitbit charge HR? I've been using that, and it's been working great for me. 

I have an Apple Watch, and I love it as a smartwatch. But honestly as a fitness tracker, it's severely lacking. It tracks activity ok and is useful for running (as long as I have my iPhone along, too), but it doesn't track sleep at all. I'm honestly thinking of getting a Charge to wear on my other wrist.

Data for data's sake is meaningless. What are the questions you intend to ask from the data, once collected?

The Withings watches are great, I own and wear one daily. You have to realize what it is though- a watch with an accelerometer.  That is literally the only sensor.  The backend app is quite good though and you can expand into the rest of the withings ecosystem (I also have their WiFi scale).  It does do sleep and steps solidly enough for a starter device. The live stream of data is a bit slow and irregular, but this means battery life is literally months and no charging happens.

Withings Ox2 has more sensors.  Something like a Fitbit surge has way more powerful sensors than a Withings watch.

I find Apple Watch's heart rate sensor great, but you'll probably want to supplement it with some third party apps, since the built-in Health app isn't particularly insightful. It's more of a repository for the data than a fully thought-out app. Here are a few suggestions:

Sleep++: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep++/id1038440371?mt=8

Cardiogram: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cardiogram-whats-your-heart/id1000017994?mt=8 (disclaimer: author)

Heart Analyzer: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/heart-analyzer/id1006420410?mt=8

I wear a moto 360v2 and swap out for a moto 360 sport for fitness and sleep.  moto body and google fit for fitness, sleep as android for sleep.  like most every other smart watch the HRM is probably close to useless in fitness applications but at rest it's much more reliable.

I tried the sony SW3 but found it too bulky and sloppy, plus it lacks HRM.

outside of smart watches I've tried the jawbone UP3 and the garmin vivosmart HR.  both were too proprietary, but the jawbone had the most potential given its diversity of sensor capabilities, albeit ridiculously underutilized.

can't comment on the withings or the apple.

My recommendation is Pebble Time Round. Their new native Health app does a great job with passive step and sleep tracking, and they are diligently pushing updates making the tracking features even better. Not quite as stylish as the Activité, sure, but with the added bonus of actually being a competent smartwatch too. 

If you don't mind the form factor, Pebble Time has the same + longer battery time (with PTR, it works fine for me to charge it daily during my morning routine), and it also has a ""smartstrap"" accessory with heart rate tracking coming soon (Tylt VU Pulse).

The sleep tracking is one of the issues that bother me the most about the Apple Watch, but the heart rate is missing on the Activité Steel. IMO the HR looks way too gadget-y for my taste. The Apple Watch doesn't have THE BEST looks but it does offer a lot of functionality within the ecosystem. Exporting my data is also kind of a priority. Mmm :/ 

Hmmm I haven't taken a look at that one yet. The problem is that I'm deeply buried in apple's ecosystem (so the Apple Watch seems like the best investment so far). I'm also a big fan of withings app and products (the activité is the best looking activity tracker w/o heart rate out there. (Misfit's wearable a close second). So keeping things within the ecosystems that I already use is definitely a priority, but I don't want to sacrifice the looks the device so much (IMO where the HR fails).
Thanks for the feedback on the Apple watch! :) (hopefully gen. 2 improves on activity tracking).

This is one of the hickups that I would like to avoid. I'm settling for ONE activity tracker instead of wearing more sensors than clothes (lol). I might as well just wait a little longer for Apple Watch Gen 2. 

Indeed. Fortunately I have no medical issues that I'm aware of, so for now I just wanted to start quantifying the usual metrics and see the development over time. Seeing my HR against my running distance/tempo is so far the only combination I'm really interested in.  (sorry for taking so long to answer) 

DUDE, Cardiogram looks amazing. Huge props. If only I had a HR sensor to properly use the app. Wearable suggestions?

**Devices**
My only current QS device is my iPhone. I was thinking of getting the apple watch now that it has automatic sleep tracking, but was also looking at 

* Fitbit Charge HR (sleep and HR tracking)
* Muse headband
* Athos clothing 
* smart blood pressure cuffs or scales

**Other**

Getting a nutrient or micronutrient blood analysis seemed like it could be actionable and informative.Don't buy tools for the sake of buying shiney tools. Start by asking yourself where you want to improve. Then buy tools that help you with the goal.

A thousand is a little low for neurofeedback, which is something that I would love to play with. 

My list would include:
-Muse
-Sunsprite
-Narrative Clip 2
-Basis Peak
-Skulpt


Blow it all on Emotiv EEG developer kit.

What do you want to learn?
1. About you
2. About data
3. About wearables

1K is small potatoes. You should try to figure out what you want to know. 

When I started in 2008, I said (just a few things), that snowballed into 30K a year for QS projects.

Before you head into this jungle, define your goal.


Some additional ideas:

- a weight scale (e.g. Withings WS-30)
- an indoor environment monitor (e.g. Netatmo or CubeSensors)
- an accurate heart/breath rate monitor for exercise (Hexoskin)
- genome and microbiome (23andMe and uBiome)

For blood testing, $1,000 won't go far unless you pick one or two biomarkers you're interested in (a one-off test isn't as interesting as is seeing how things change over time).

I'd like to track sleep and heart rate. I have some joint issues so things like athos are appealing (want to make sure I don't create muscle imbalances to compensate) .

I'd like to track a wide array of biomarkers to see if I'm healthy now and to establish a baseline to see how they change over time 

Why sunsprite?

I've heard it is difficult to get information back out of the peak.

The Apple Watch is certainly more stylish but it seems like the variety and quality of the sensors is inferior to the peak


To what end? I've heard of people using similar devices to accelerate their meditation technique improvement.

It helps you get an adequate amount of light for resetting your circadian clock within the first two hours of waking. This helps with sleep and mood. I noticed significant mood changes when I hit my light exposure goal a few days in a row. The reason that it's on my list is I dropped and broke mine and want a replacement.

The SunSprite captures both (at minute resolution) the brightness of the light you're exposed to (in lux) and the UV index. Former is useful if you want to know e.g. how exposure to bright light late in the day affects your sleep; latter if you're curious how light exposure affects your Vitamin D levels.

That was the case with the first Basis Band. But with the Peak, it allows export of your data and it connects to Healthkit. You can use the QS Access app to get your data out of Healthkit. 

Oh,  I have the Mind wave device, and I use it to track my mental and cognitive  state (theta etc) while I'm selling on the phone and coding. 

By using biofeedback and tracking my work performance I'm able to grasp the sensation of optimal emotional states before, and as I work. 

For example if I'm in a low energy mode then that hits my sales yield so an email task is more suited for that task. 

Also by overlaying different data like my diet I can see patterns and compare that to my base work trackers. Keystrokes per minute code review, sales per hour etc. 

Some examples were that you can see the brain entrainment from binaural works really well,  sugars make me hyped and feeling peppy but my brain  is foggy. 

Some of my experiments are usually  on www.mybodylab.com

If so, can anyone recommend a good app for this?Not found that myself.
Best i could do is.

* Android Sleep
* Samsung Health
* Map My Run
* My Fitness Pal

I've been using mySymptoms for food,  pain,  asthma, allergy tracking (you could probably track mood in it very easily); Basis Peak for fitness tracking.  Less than perfect,  but its enough for me for now. 

  If myfitnesspal added symptom tracking, I'd drop mySymptoms.  Cronometer looks like it would do everything too, but I don't want to pay for pro which would give the ability to track custom metrics (symptoms or moods for example).

Try TapLog with a normal alarm tobprompt data entry.

Optimized is a good app that can be linked to Jawbone/Fitbit. It's also great for tracking time usage. 
But it seems like they stopped development for the app, which is a bummer...
But you can log your mood, stress levels, etc and see correlated graphs, which is pretty cool. 

Android or iOS? How much time are you willing to invest into 1. capturing the data, and 2. analyzing the data?


I'm looking to build something like this. Let me know if there is anything else you'd like in the app.

Note: I'm using iOS. Don't want to spend more than $15 dollars total, but would be willing to spend more if the features were all inclusive

Enquos at enquos.com is great for that.

[removed]

I log to a text file mostly for work purposes, but also for some things that I want to track. I keep a text file open all the time called wip.md and group tasks in ""projects"". Each work project (an app I'm working on) is usually a project, marketing in general is also a project, and so on. I have a simple macro (tt) that automatically inserts the current timestamp. So when I start working on something, I write down the project name and the start time (by typing tt), and when I'm done, the end time e.g.

Project X 01:00 PM - 02:32 PM.

The file also tracks the tasks that I did for each project. Every morning, I start by renaming the previous day's file to its timestamp (e.g. 20160217.md) and creating a new file (with unfinished tasks). I have a simple script that can print out the time I spent for each project for each day, or any year/month. I have been doing this for several years. I write the script and insert yesterday's time spent into that file.

If anyone is interested, I can write up something more detailed. But this is the gist of it.

An app that breaks down time usage per day on a easy to read daily timeline is exactly what I've been using and what I've been wanting to upgrade. 

This looks very neat. Too bad it's only on Android for now, but I'll keep an eye out for the iOS version. Thanks for this.

Good idea! What will you do with it though? A big monolithic lump of data isn't very useful without metadata for e.g. ""show me all the times I met John Smith"". I guess you can archive it for when that tech becomes available?

Google Photos is already pretty good for extracting metadata from your photos. My friend uses the Autographer every waking hour and uploads them to Google Photos. I was impressed by his ability to look up every time that we hung out. The service will group photos by objects that appear in them (e.g., tree, boat).

If you want to be able to look back at this data when you are 80 (and assuming you're not over 70 already), you'll need to have a low-tech solution for storing the data (e.g. only use the most common data formats, or even do printouts like [Feltron](http://feltron.com/)).

I think the trick to dealing with noise on that device is to be extremely picky about which data you actually analyze—what I do is break up the data into two-second-long epochs and then exclude any that have large voltage excursions that would indicate a blink artifact, loss of contact with the skin, etc. When I compute measures like peak alpha frequency from the cleaned data they tend to be fairly stable across trials and also fall into the middle percentiles of a normative dataset from a regular research system which  suggests that it’s getting most of the noise out.

The disadvantage to this is that occasionally there won’t be any epochs that meet the criteria and the user won’t get any results. But that’s probably better than giving bad results.

I’m planning to eventually support the Muse as well but I decided to launch it with just the Neurosky first since I already had one.

I believe if it's our goal to improve in something that is subjective (have a better attitude, be more motivated) - we often must track measures that are inherently more subjective. Even though there is some sacrifice in data quality, I think it's better than less relevant but objective data points (like steps).

Two questions - 

1. Are there methodologies you've seen that work well with subjective goals?
2. Have you looked for ways to objectify more subjective data? If so - what has worked?There's nothing wrong with subjective measures, just be aware of the limitations. For example, it's easy to know that you feel better than yesterday (relative), but hard to tell if you feel even better than when you felt great two weeks ago (absolute).

Sometimes you can find a technical solution to get more objective data (e.g. use voice analysis to infer your mood). Maybe you can get additional subjective measures from different angles (e.g. have your SO rate your mood as well). Or you can try to reduce the subjectivity a bit (e.g. see [Moodscope's approach](https://www.moodscope.com/about/how-it-works/demo)).


Hey, I haven't looked into other methodologies used but in my own quantifications I try to address this problem by trying to put numbers to those subjective variables based on a predetermined scale and just keeping it as consistent as I can.

For example, I quantify my energy level on a scale of 1-5. 5 is fully rested. 4 is could use a few more minutes. 3 is could use another hour. 2 is could use several hours. 1 is no sleep recovery.

The actually numbers and scale are arbitrary. The important thing is just being as strict and consistent as you can. The only real downfall I see to this method is that it's not as comparable between people as like steps or heart rate.

Reading speed on novels for me.  Not a direct measure buta good way to infer a bunch of subjective things

And something that my doctors are more comfortable using than my subjective ratings of brain fog

Definitely. We have poor memory of our subjective moods week over week, which makes consistent rating difficult. Those are some awesome proxies you mentioned.

I definitely think a bulkier method could be done by using PANAS - and I love how Moodscope approached this test. 

Personally, I've always been curious about interpersonal relationship measures like trustworthiness and supportiveness. I actually built an app that sources this data from your social network, but it's hard to use in a broader scale since it requires a large number of participants to all want to rate each other.

Actually writing out a scale is important for me. I rate my headache pain for instance and have a 1 to 10 scale with definite milestones like 'distracting but manageable,' 'interference with daily tasks,' and 'cannot function, must lay down in sensory depravation to cope.'

This is something I get asked.  I have found that, for me, I adjust the scale to norm my condition and move the to the middle over time because when I am having chronic sleep issues it feels like I just need a few more minutes when, if treated I will sleep for 12 hour or more straight.

Which might not be as much of an issue in healthy people but I wanted to point out the scale shift problem I had so you can watch for it.

I've started using a stroop test to try to gauge selective attention and focus, just started testing how my measures vary over time

That's really interesting. Thanks for sharing.

I agree.  I have started using the Mankowski Pain scale and actually carrying it with me because I find my norms are hard for medical professionals to understand sometimes

(http://members.upnaway.com/~poliowa/Pain%20Scale.html)

But the painkillers stuff is not as useful and I don't include it.  

Let me know how that goes!

My heart rate is typically between 55 to 75 bpm at night depending on the stage of sleep I'm in. Even so, every once in a while, I'll get spikes >= 100 bpm and even as high as 125 bpm. Lately I've found that I'm always tired in the mornings regardless of how much I sleep, so this may be related.

Any ideas what might be going on?

30 minute period from last night: http://i.imgur.com/MePqyRu.pngYou might have sleep apnea.  When you go apneic, your lowered oxygen saturation can drive heart rate up.  After an episode, restored oxygen levels allow for normalized perfusion and your heart rate levels out. Also the fact that you don't always feel well rested in the morning is another common presenting symptom. 

Hey, I'm not sure what you use to track your heart rate, but with the Basis Peak I've heard it attributed to rolling around. I found that if my watch is a little more snug it reduces some of the spikes.

I wouldn't necessarily look at those first as the reason for you being tired.

I noticed similar spikes in mine from nightmares. 

Had the usual horrible dental trauma lucid nightmare not long after I started wearing an Apple Watch 24/7. You know, the kind where you have to physically check your teeth to make sure they're still there. Somehow managed to make a mental note that this was at 3AM. Checked my heart log the next day, and it went from a constant 55 to about 144 at 3AM then back down.

TL;DR: I'm going to die in my sleep at some point.

You might want to take the datato your doc and talk to them about getting evaluated for dysautonomia which can cause that kind of heart rate spike.

The rilt table is no fun, but if you do have a problem there is a new promising drug so you are not limited to salt pills and compression socks anymore.


For what it's worth, I usually get multiple spikes during the night around 100. For example, here's a graph from last night recorded on an Apple Watch:
  http://imgur.com/kHZPses

Normal REM sleep does involve increased heart rate variability. But if you're sleepy in the mornings, you might want to try a sleep study to rule out any medical conditions.

I've seen HR spikes that coincide with apnea events in my CPAP data.  Can't hurt to see if a home sleep study is indicated.

It's the Polar H7 ECG strap. I've tested it out to see how it acts when I roll around, and it stays constant unless it is pulled away from my skin, but that shows up as an instantaneous spike that immediately drops when it retains contact.

Thanks!I'm just curious. Is there any reason that you chose to go for a phone service rather than like a text service?

Yeah, i'm turned off by needing to provide a phone number 

text messages are too easy to 'dismiss'.  The number of times I have 'swiped' close a reminder and then promptly forgotten to do something means I wants something that is a bit more persistent.  Also it's a lot more accessible.  The idea is to offer voice to text in the future.  Also have sms features but that is way down the feature list at this stage.  Let's see if the initial version gets any traction!

Thanks for your interest :)

yep it's not for everyone.  
Note the calls are text to speech and aren't manned by humans... 
the main point is to have something that persists and provide a 'prompt' for answers.

I agree that it's not for everybody. That's why I was curious what your reasoning was. I personally don't have the occasion to openly talk on the phone consistently throughout the day, so that was my main concern. But good luck with the service anyways! I know there will be people that don't have those same concerns.

[edit] I have also trialed most common activity monitors from Fitbit, Jawbone, Misfit, Xaomi, Nike, etc.

Oh it is because I have a weird genetic disorder, among other things it causes sudden drops in blood pressure and that leads to adrenaline spikes which leads to my pulse rate going up.

Some biofeedback training has been really helpful in stopping the spike when I make a specific effort, but we want to see if I can maybe make them shorter by using that technique in response to spikes and maybe longterm make my body a little more tolerant of the changes.
So yeah, not normal, but normal for me.

Check out the [Empatica Embrace](https://www.empatica.com/product-embrace). Don't know if it would work for you, but it's meant to detect such episodes before they happen and alert you so you can take action. Once your adrenaline has spiked and the heart rate has gone way up, you probably don't need a device to tell you that...

The E4 wristband is pretty much exactly what I dream of, but is a big lift for something I don't know will help.

The embrace is awesome but doesn't do HR

You would think I would notice the spikes, but generally it isn't obvious to me because it is just something I see as normal, learning to recognize the feeling is one of the goals.

I think thanks to the forum I have a solid plan now.  I am going with the Fitbit Charge HR because it looks like the IFTTT integration will let me do an alert (and barring that my wife says the API will let her write me one)

If that works at all and looks like it is helping me level out some then I will ask for a script for the e4 and try to get it covered as medical equipment or somesuch

Is the Fitbit IFTTT integration sufficiently realtime for this application?

Not sure, but there is the bribe my wife backup because API :)

Also, it seems significant that the tracking is being externally imposed, rather than internally motivated.

I've had this problem too so also have a startup to try and solve it... [badgerme.co](http://www.badgerme.co) is about to go into limited release (alpha if you want to call it that!) 
Good for all the 'hard to track' things like ""did you meditate?"" or ""what was your weight today"" (if you don't have a smart scale!) or ""how many hours did you work on project x for today?""

Hit me up if you want an invite

Good luck with the increased tracking. What did you learn from a year of tracking? What spurred you to expand your data collecting?

Ok I am not sure it is worth the $150 but the writings scale is the favorite device in my house right now and it works for me and my wife giving us a daily weight, pulse, BF and putting a weather report on the scale.  (OK why that is awesome might not be obvious, but it helps make getting on the scale to figure out what to wear just a thing you do)

If you are thinking about adding any non-phone tools this is the one that is the clearest win for me.

If you are looking for phone apps IFTTT and DO are what I end up using the most

This looks great, I'm checking it out now! Thanks, domainkiller!

I'm using 

the iOS HealthKit app (for caffein, water, exercise, heart rate, etc), 

FatSecret (for tracking macros and calories), 

Activity Tracker (for a breakdown of what tasks I spend most time on), 

Sleep Better (for tracking sleep and waking me up with a smart alarm), 

DayOne (for journaling and recording significant events in detail), 

Instant (for mobile device usage and location history), 

and I plan to start using Way Of Life soon. 

I'm looking at some other apps for calculating blood alcohol level by drink consumption and perhaps something for tracking my mood. 

My goal is to collect as much data as possible for at least one month and then to thoroughly analyse it in order to help make the right decisions to optimise my lifestyle and mental performance at University. I'd also like to have a thorough data set to look back on at the end of the year — perhaps even to make an infographic. 

Sounds like a fun exercise! Make sure you're able to export usable data from all the services you plan to use. Also, one month of data may not be enough (but it's a good start), and it's a lot easier to gain useful insights when you are doing (at least somewhat) controlled experiments.

Could you elaborate on ideas for 'controlled experiments'? :) Also, what are some non-obvious metrics which are worth tracking? 

You likely already suspect certain behaviors or environmental factors to be beneficial or harmful; now see if you can collect some data to prove those suspicions!

Some (maybe) non-obvious metrics that can be helpful, depending on what you are looking at:

- indoor air quality (Netatmo, CubeSensors or Foobot)
- (sun)light exposure (SunSprite)
- media consumption (Last.fm, Trakt.tv)
- productivity or just time spent in front of the computer (RescueTime)
- location incl places (Moves)
- body weight and composition (Withings)
- supplements and meal frequency etc (manual logging using an app like Nomie)

It takes a very data driven approach to weight loss trying to smooth out the day to day bumps in scale measurements by using something called an [exponential moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing). This is great when you are in the midst of losing weight, but I don't think it's the best for projecting into the future and setting reasonable goals 3, 6 or 12 months down the line.

If you spend time on /r/personalfinance you've probably come across the website [FIRECalc](http://www.firecalc.com/), which projects your future assets based on historical market data.

I wanted to take the spirit of the hackers diet (use some math to tell if you are on track, and if you go off track eat less) and the methodology of the FIRECalc and apply them to weight loss and long term goals.

My final product was this [chart] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qib0353Iq39zkqILZfpLQEI3seqOPDGSXmAsdPNYewk/pubchart?oid=2059246661&format=interactive) which takes my current weight and creates many potential future trajectories based off of my daily difference in weight. To bias it towards recent measurements, the sampling is biased exponentially towards recent measurements.

Concretely, all trajectories start with my current weight: 220lbs.

Then based on the deltas between recent measurements, I project my weight for tomorrow, taking 220 + x where x is sampled from [ -2.9
1.95
-1
-0.95
-0.7
-0.2
1.7
-0.15
-2.55
1.05
-0.6475
0
-2.7525
2.37]

This process is then repeated to project my weight in 6 months. I can then say that based on recent measurements, I have a 50% chance of weighing 200lbs in Febuary. If I were to start eating poorly, this projection would start to flatten out (or go up), because more recent measurements are more likely to be selected than old ones.

The nice thing about this approach is that it doesn't assume anything a priori. It doesn't assume that ""you can only lose 2 pounds a week"", or that I intend to eat at a 500 calories deficit. It is simply based off of my behavior and what the scale says.

To make it easier, I have a withings wifi enabled scale and hook directly into google spreadsheets using [ifttt](https://ifttt.com/).

You might also be interested in the exponential moving average (and second order exponential moving average) [chart of my weight  in 2015](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qib0353Iq39zkqILZfpLQEI3seqOPDGSXmAsdPNYewk/pubchart?oid=1944033497&format=interactive). It isn't pretty, but it is motivating for what happens when I don't pay attention.FYI - Libra for Android uses the formulas from The Hacker's Diet to calculate your weight trends.  It's a great app!

Does FIRECalc take natural, periodic fluctuations into account?

Interesting idea! I'm fan of any forecast that shows the probabilities of outcomes. So much more useful.

Love libra! :) I've got my weight tracked for 15 years :D

It doesn't, it simply replays the stock market from various points in time. If you have a noisy dataset that has ""seasonality"" the a third order exponential moving average can capture that. Second order emas capture trends so they will track weight loss quite closely as opposed to showing the lag that standard moving averages have.

Unfortunately the term ""HRV"" is used a bit loosely as an umbrella term for everything from general variation in heart rate to actual time and frequency domain HRV calculations (such as RMSSD, HF/LF).

In most cases the optical/PPG sensors are used for detecting general rise and fall in heart rate which is a very basic form of ""HRV"" and can be useful for getting a ballpark estimate on whether you are stressed or not.

In some few cases, the raw signal from those sensors or even the finger over the phone's camera could be interpolated and processed in a more intelligent way to make them more meaningful for what may be considered ""true"" HRV calculations such as RMSSD.

When moving or in less than ideal circumstances the accuracy for HRV is not comparable with the Polar H7.

I use a samsung S6 with a polar h7 for motoring my HRV.   I expect that the chest strap monitor is far more accurate than using the phones sensor.

I've already tried using a Withings Pulse as a sleep tracker, but I don't really like it.  Its analysis is obviously garbage (at least for me) and it seems that pairing it has disabled the phone-based pedometer of the Withings app (which I liked).Ive used fitbit and basis, I prefer basis for sleep.

I think it comes down to what you mean by ""effective"" - and I've got to say this is a concept I'm still wrestling with when it comes to self tracking generally.

Personally, I've found Sleep Cycle to be a reasonable app for tracking sleep - it's especially nice now that it can just use a microphone to track sleep. I'm not at all convinced of its accuracy past ""time gone to bed"" and ""time woken up"", but it gets an approximately accurate data into HealthKit and its alarm features are excellent.

Paired to Sleep Cycle through HealthKit, I like to use the Lark chat app. Sleep Cycle is very focussed on data and doesn't do much in the way of giving advice, but Lark is great at congratulating me on good habits and nudging me when I get into bad habits. I'd strongly recommend it, just because I find it to be fun and because it actually gives me the occasional actionable insight.

If what you're really looking for is accurate and extensive data I would probably look at a Beddit. It's great for tracking multiple metrics - sleep, heart rate and respiration rate, and from what I understand, it's quite accurate (I could be wrong about that though).

When I was using a Jawbone UP24 I found it to be quite good at both tracking and giving me feedback. However, I'm not sure the Jawbone ecosystem is going anywhere so I probably wouldn't invest in a Jawbone device right now.

EDIT: I should also say that HealthKit is an iOS-only feature; and that Beddit works with HealthKit, so you could link it to Lark easily too.

Just having a record of when you went to bed (and when you got up) can be quite valuable. But it's not clear if the sleep metrics these devices produce are an improvement over simply noting how refreshed you feel in the morning (and how tired you get in the early afternoon).

Using a Basis Peak and really love the detailed statistics and accuracy.

I've been using the service since before the FDA came after them. Feedback was novel, but generally useless. In the past year or so, they've added a few additional studies and interpretations that have been helpful. More importantly, because I was grandfathered into having access to the health data, I was able to help a family member diagnose their genetic disease even though they joined after the FDA debacle.

About damn time.

If I understand correctly, you can get the raw data and process it yourself.  This is my plan.  There are several tutorials on the web.

Also, 23andme and working with the FDA and as more reports get approved, the information they provide will increase.

I've been using 23andme since before the FDA issue. So I have access to the non-gimped health reports. It had some actionable data in it, and I did use it to diagnose a genetic disease (hereditary hemochromatosis) and start treatment years before any symptoms or organ damage.

But even if you can't get all the health information they previously gave out, you do have control over the raw data and you can use any number of third party apps to analyse that data. It takes more work though.

I'd say it's worth it.

They raised the price, and also now you get fewer SNPs in addition to the gimped interpretation. So all in all, a real kick in the teeth for anyone who was waiting. They seem to be serious about the price increase and restrictions, so with Veritas offering whole genomes for $1k to PGP participants, you might well be better off with that (it's only 5x more)...

I'm a 46 year old, 350lb guy about to aggressively attempt to ""cut myself in half."" Because of this, there's no ""running"" in my immediate future, just walking.

I currently don't wear a watch or anything wrist mounted, and don't use a ""belt clip"" style tracker.

All the ""steps per day"" tracking is coming from my iPhone 6S+ which is never apart from me. 

So my question is this: What am I going to gain from a wrist mounted or belt mounted tracker that I don't already get from the iPhone + Runkeeper + Withings app?

I don't really care about the actual count of steps per day as long as they're consistent and I can see ""I walked 10% less today"". 

Also, for planned periods of exercise where I go to a local park and walk several miles, is there a measurable difference between ""phone in pocket"" and ""phone in upper arm band""?I've been exactly where you are, almost the same weight and age and did what you want to do. (http://www.chrisdancy.com)

You are correct. If you have your phone with you, you won't gain that much more insight having a wrist band at this point in your journey. 

Also logging sleep is important but apps like ""Sleep Cycle"" work on your phone alone and integrate to HealthKit (your phone's health system where you check your steps), Myfitness pal will log food to HealthKit.

Seeing your sleep and calories in the crude HealthKit interface is an eye opener.

In the beginning make your goal not to lose weight, but to get stuff logged. 

The act of logging is enough to help you understand your day.

Next do simple life hacks with logging. 

1.  If you want fast food, walk to it. For most people there is a fast food restaurant within 3 miles. (You can eat what you want, but you have to work for it)
2.  Don't eat after 8pm. (Learn to shut down your systems)
3.  Take a photo of every meal (even snacks)
4.  While watching TV or on the computer, just pick your legs up in a slow march or Jane fonda style. (every moment can be a ""step"")
5.  Move certain foods to a fridge or space outside of the kitchen. (out of sight out of mind)
6.  Take a shower twice a day (no one likes to eat after they shower)

Get use to just ""moving"" and looking at your body as a system (Sleep, Food, Activity).

You're on an amazing journey, be prepared not everyone will be there in the end.

I've been using the UP band pretty consistently for 1.5 years. The step and sleep accuracy is amazing.

(However, I just discovered that getting my sleep data from it into Google Sheets may be a little trickier than I thought.. Seems they disabled a useful IFTTT trigger :( )

That's what I figured, that the phone would track accurately enough.

The rest is actually pretty easy for me once I get enough days ""on plan"" it becomes habit. It's that transition that sucks.

October 2011 to April 2012 I went 319 to 224 with keto alone, very little exercise. Then fell off the wagon, my stress levels went way up and I gained it all back and then some. Starting the new program today at 345.1.

Current tracking (Almost all of which starts today, Nov 29):

* iPhone 6s+ step tracking
* WiThings Smart Body Analyzer (Weight, Bodyfat, ambient temp, CO2, worthless pulse)
* WiThings Blood Pressure Cuff (Blood Pressure, Pulse)
* Reporter App (Mood, General info)
* Sleep Cycle App (Sleep duration, quality, Pulse on waking)
* Heart Rate app (Pulse, same people as sleep cycle)
* Day One (General journaling)
* Rescue Time (Computer use)
* Runkeeper (Intentional walks for exercise)
* Automatic (Driving, Location, Fuel Use)
* Moves (Location)
* Manual circumference measurements (waist, bicep, etc using an Orbitape)
* Weekly progress photos front and side, with and without shirt.

Probably buying a finger clip blood oximeter and a thermometer. Considering buying a glucometer if I can wrap my head around the cost of test strips.

You'll notice that right now that doesn't include food tracking. Starting today I begin three shakes a day of [Keto Chow](https://www.thebairs.net/product-category/ketochow/) for tightly controlled and calculated macros. I've done both heavy keto and ""liquid only"" diets in the past so I know they work.

My 95 pound loss earlier was helped along with tracking, though only scale weight was tracked. I aggregated the daily weights in some code I wrote that generated a chart on a web page that all my friends had access to, so I knew people were watching.

I'm going to do similar with this and start using the APIs of all these services to aggregate my data locally.

The big change this time around, other than more tracking, is that the last time was with nearly zero exercise and this time is going to be with a regular program of bodyweight calisthetics and walking/stationary bike.

I actually just now clicked through to your site AFTER I typed all that. My goal is to get on your level. I need tracking to be as normal as brushing my teeth and taking a shower. So the above description of my tracking is for other people who may find this post, you obviously know what's out there :)

Is there a machine I can buy to test my blood sugar?  I'd like to find out which foods cause large spikes after eating.

Can someone recommend a good brand?  How often after eating do you need to wait to use it?  Does it require withdrawing blood?

Thanks for the help!You're looking for a basic glucose meter. Don't have any specific recommendations; they're all required to be accurate. Just make sure you get one that lets you export your data (or that works with a service like Glooko).

Continuous glucose meters are another option, but they're more expensive, and don't entirely remove the need for pricking your finger.

Like zenobase said, you're looking for a glucometer. You can pick one up in any pharmacy for about $20-30 in the US. The cables connecting I've found to be a bit harder to come by (FreeStyle cable looks like $30-60 on amazon, but there may be equivalent cables for cheaper). Since you're not a diabetic and probably wont be testing more than a couple of times a day, I'd just manually add the entries. Pay attention to whether you can easily get replacement strips at your local pharmacy. They're usually fairly expensive off-prescription.

Testing your blood sugar requires a quick pin-prick to the finger (by a device) and putting the blood on a strip. You probably wont end up doing nearly as much cleaning as in this video but:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMMpeLLgdgY

Thanks for the info. I'll check it out.

I was really hoping there was something out there not requiring a pin prick.  

The idea was to, for example, eat an apple and see how it spikes my blood sugars.  Eat a candy bar and see how it spikes, etc etc.  



Also check Amazon for test strips. Accu-chek Aviva strips go for about $25-$30 for 50 strips. 

It's not too bad. The pin pricks don't really hurt when you figure out where on your finger bleeds and doesn't hurt (near the tip but somewhere between the midline and the side).

I'm not sure how much of an effect you'll see though. Might be good to look for some literature to get a feel for what your blood sugar would be after eating something small (for me, an apple would be +15*5 so I'd be around 175 with no insulin but with insulin I'd still probably end up in the 140s.

Reporter gets everything you just asked for and you can export.

Will it be benificial or will it cause more problems than it will fix?I think it could go either way.  Self monitoring can help patients and doctors treat condition more accurately than relying on what a patient remembers to mention during a regular checkup.  On the flip side, we have insurance companies requiring people to undergo biometric screenings so that they can penalize or drop unhealthy customers.  

We still have the risk that any data gathered via self monitoring can be used to help pad an insurance company's profits instead of actually helping the patient.

Financially they might be a very real influence. There was an extensive Goldman Sachs report on how the IoT may affect healthcare financially (I think it's titled Digital Revolution comes to US Healthcare). Looks like a great deal of money could be saved - billions of dollars - especially in the field of chronic disease management. Personally, I think those who are chronically ill and therefore need to monitor their health signs practically 24/7 can benefit from wearable devices the most, and there are some great ones already available. In that sense, QS will fix problems rather than cause them. But there are still a lot of devices that really need work despite being based on great ideas, and there is still a lot of uncertainty about in which direction the trend will go. It can be used to gather data for less 'noble' purposes (yes, insurance companies etc.).

Even in the US, health insurance companies are not allowed to ""penalize or drop unhealthy customers"". Life insurance companies could do so, but so far haven't seem very interested.

The biggest problem I see right now, is that most technologies are not intended for medical purposes. In order to revolutionize the healthcare system, we will NEED to have FDA aproved technologies, and so far it seems that the target audience for wearables is more the athlete type of person rather than the chronically ill...


Yeah, except for the fact that they *are* allowed to ""discount"" rates for healthy customers, which gives you the same end result. 

My previous employer made its employees take a yearly biometric screen, and if you had any unhealthy indicators you had to show 'improvement' every 6 months or you would lose your so-called discount. 

The loss of the discount doubled the out of pocket cost for people who were overweight, had high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes.

For me it boils down to analysis paralysis, with too much planning and no doing because I always think that there are too many confounding factors to distinguish true causal relationships. 
I'm interested in collecting data to make targeted life changes/improvements, and not for the sake of data collection and visualisation. 
Perhaps if you will share some of your successes and experimental setup, it will give me the kick I need to replicate your findings in my own life. 
Appreciate any help. The biggest realization I had was that I can simply change my mood through willpower alone. Every morning I would get up and log my mood. After a while I said, ""fuck it, I don't want to be stressed today."" It worked, just the act of quantifying showed me that I am not my quantified self.

My calorie tracking gives me a pretty good idea of not just my calorie requirement, but if subtle weight changes are muscle, fat, or water.

Tracking my alcohol consumption told me I can have two drinks and still perform awesome in bed.

Tracking my sleep told me I need at least six hours of sleep to have a productive morning.

I also had some jaw dropping realizations that are too personal to revel here, but they revolutionized the way I deal with certain people in my life.

But honest, while the data viz and number crunching help, the bulk of my insight comes from the process of getting up every morning and logging some 200 data points into a spread sheet. 

So my recommendation is to start small. ID something in your life you want to hack and start tracking it.

If you're experimenting with nootropics/drugs, then I would recommend developing a methodology for administering a placebo-control trial on yourself.

For example, you might fill one container with capsules containing a white crystalline powder you're interested in testing the effect of. Fill an identical container with capsules containing powdered sugar. Ask a friend to label the containers (e.g., A and B). Take A pills for 1 week while recording your reaction to them in a log (e.g., energy levels on a scale of 1-10, happiness on 1-10, etc...). Take B pills for 1 week while recording your reaction to them. Then have your friend reveal which container had which contents. Is your average score for the ""real"" drug statistically higher than the placebo?

Dont under play the value of visualistion. Using just basic tools available through web/phone apps I am monitoring.

* Fitbit Steps/Sleep
* MyFitnessPal for diet intake & body stats (manually scale)
* Training with a Garmin 910XT HRM/GPS (running, bike)
* Moves for daily timeline GPS/Steps
* SleepCycle HRM for resting HR
* Expereal for mood 
* Logsit to log habit data

Now what do I get from all this. Well a bunch of data for data sake of course which I hope will prove useful when i come to get a bit more serious. 

However, the major benefit i have seeing thus far through the process of collecting and visualising you are developing good habits of being more mindful of your well being. I am operating on gut feel at this stage with some data trends to back things up.

An example over the last 2 weeks. I have been feeling stressful and notice my resting heart rate has risen. But it could also be due to a diet change or loosing weight during that time. Shrugs. Might ask the doctor about it next time.

What will be the next benefit ... im not sure but I guess I will find out soon! Good luck

Establishing a causal relationship can be tricky, but establishing the lack of a strong relationship (which is far more common) is much easier...

Can you elaborate on how you distinguish between fat/muscle/water weight fluctuations from your data tracking?

Also, I wasn't consciously aware of it, but you are absolutely right about the mood point. Very often I have a negative attitude about my day and it ruins my day. But if I tell myself to smile, take a big breath, and that it will be okay, the majority of the time my day will be measurably less cruddy. 

I am interested in nootropics, but I haven't been serious about it yet. Mainly I have just been reading about people's experiences with them. 
...but if I ever do, I'll make sure to come back to your comment. I don't want to religiously spend money on something that is no better than a placebo. 

That is a very good point of view. 
Any particular things that you have shown to *not* have a causal relationship in your life that scientific literature indicates should be causal for the general population?

I'm on a 500 calorie deficit at the moment so my weight loss is pretty predictable. I also track my body measurements so, sadly, I know roughly how much of that weight is muscle. Deviations from what's expected I assume to be water weight.

- Offline (for privacy) and allows export via email or USB
- Very customisable trackers: allows you to create trackers with textboxes, numeric values, yes/no, multiple choice, sliders, tickboxes etc and allows you to create custom formulas using other data within the tracker. 
- I guess it works most similarly to a spreadsheet but it has several features which make it better suited for self-tracking e.g. each entry is automatically tagged with time/date, it's lightweight and quick to use, formats automatically for numerous variable types, some in-app data visualisation, etc

Overview of the app: http://www.realidata.com/cgi-bin/rTracker/iPhone/rTracker-main.pl
This guy's blog post outlines exactly what I'm looking for: http://measuredme.com/2012/09/in-search-of-the-perfect-quantified-self-app-part-2-the-apps-that-track-them-all-html/[nomie](http://nomie.io/) might be worth a look. You create custom trackers and 'tap' the icon to record event, timestamp, gps, and optional notes. But no special forms like radio buttons, yes/no, etc. Data can be automatically synced to dropbox or your own nosql database. Pretty lightweight app and very easy to use (open, tap, done) - I've enjoyed it so far.

For school I'm doing a project that involves Quantified Self and school. The question is: ""In 15 years, how can Quantified Self be used in schools?"".

Do you have any places for me to search for information?

And also, how do you think Quantified Self will be used in schools?

Thanks in advance!Hi, sounds like a fun project. You can look at all the possible measurable variables, like heart rate, blood pressure, concentration etc.

Maybe students could earn extra credit for staying focussed, healthy etc.? I don't know any sources right now, but I'd say google is your best friend in this situation.

Good luck!

What about looking at how schools currently do quantification? Standardised tests are big business. Every student gets letter grades and report cards.

Additionally, students can be measured individually with psychological assessments for example with regards to ADHD. This can result in individualised education plans or other accommodations.

Maybe look into how schools in your area deal with ""special education.""

I spoke Tuesday morning after Victor Lee at the conference in June of this year. He had a genius presentation on QS and kids.  It might be online. I would reach out to him and ask him for a copy.

I've been googling for days now, I thought about searching for trends and different discussions about using the data.
What do you think about using competition and measuring the level of concentration between different people in the class to increase performance and productivity?

Thanks! That's a very good idea!

oh thanks! this will deffinetly help!

Well, it is always interesting to know this data. Although I am wondering if measuring this would distract them? Also I think it would improve the motivation of students. Next question is how you would measure this without violating the constitution of rights?



In terms of reports and individualised education plans, maybe look at how teachers use the Khan Academy platform with their classes? I seem to remember cool things on how it made the class semi self paced and changed the activities they do during class.

I think that if the student has something for monitoring brain waves on, and it isn't a huge thing, it won't be any trouble. Also at the beginning I think the parents would need to sign in order to be allowed to monitor their brain waves. Just so you know, this is more for special ed. students, not normal students. With normal students it's just important to create competition in the class.

well, i'm definetly not familliar with Khan academy platform, but I'll definetly look it up!

Sounds really interesting! I have 0 experience on this subject, but good luck!

I found this video of how a teacher in Poland uses it. It shows her graphically specific trouble spots for each student and reduces the time it might have taken her to look for those trouble areas. It also has a gamification aspect to it and some of the students compete with each other in the video.

Some folks want to lose weight, some want to keep their blood sugar in check and others are looking at more cutting edge things like internal bacteria or brain waves to see how these impact other things in their life.

Is anyone collecting data without much of a short-to-mid-term goal in mind? I myself count steps, weight, sleep and heart rate, but I don't really do much with this data right now. I suppose the reason I collect this data is simply because I can, and so why not? I'm also really interested in how this data might be used in the future, in both establishing a health baseline (potentially highlighting medical conditions before they become acutely symptomatic) and also for feeding in to a health-AI like Watson Health. Particularly on the health-AI front, I feel like having a whole load of data already collected to feed in to the system could be advantageous.

My friends think I'm crazy. They keep asking me why I've spent so much money on ""fitness stuff"" when I apparently have no interest in getting fit, and I find it really hard to explain this to them. Is anyone else in this boat?As someone known for this http://www.chrisdancy.com I can tell you one fact of data collection:

1. You can't learn from what you don't collect.

Keep saving, one day, when the time is right, you will find a reason to look for an answer.

Unlike the rest of the world, you will find it.



Nope, I collect data for a purpose, then I analyse it with that purpose in mind.

I think hoping that a future AI will use your backlog of step-counts to predict your health outcomes is unwarranted.  
It's your life and your time, and collecting the data probably does not take that much time, right? And what is time for but wasting, right? I mean, I am commenting on reddit so I am wasting my own time right now. If you like doing it, fuck the haters.  
Doesn't make it *not* silly, though!

As long as it doesn't take significant time away from other activities, tracking for no specific purpose is harmless.

And as you noted, it can be beneficial in other ways. First, it is important to be able to track certain things for a good interval in order to establish a base line for yourself. This will give you an idea of what is normal for YOU, and perhaps allow you to get some early warning if something starts to go wrong.

Second, sometimes you just have to play with data a bit before you can figure out how it can be useful. I drop tracking certain data all the time, but I've found I need to collect it for a while before I can figure out whether or not it is useful.

I kind of think establishing a baseline is phase I or tracking. Phase II is doing some analysis of your data to see if you can tease out any interesting correlations. And you can't do that unless you have a decent amount of data. But you can start doing some simple correlations with a spreadsheet and see if there are any significant correlations between certain variables and think ""Oh that's interesting. I wonder why that is"".

Phase III is doing interventions to see if you can change certain variables. I'm doing this now to see if increased fiber intake leads to decreased HDL.

I used to collect data for the fuck of it, but n=1 always makes it very difficult to learn much.

I regularly cull data that is not earning its keep.

Collecting data for no reason reminds me of hoarding - some people collect physical things for no reason, or buy books they cannot possibly ever read...

I'm a data collector in real life for other, non-QS stuff and let me just say that sometimes I've just had a gut feeling that something would be useful and then it did turn out to be. I started collecting this one type of data ten years ago and all of a sudden it got really important to have. And I was the only one who had it. 

>  I feel like having a whole load of data already collected to feed in to the system could be advantageous.

This is the reason I do it, although it may at times feel like it has taken a life of it's own. Data not logged is lost. I like to think that in years I will have a large record of much of my life that I can use to aid recall and see the direction that my life has gone.

But I log more than what you mentioned, and my friends don't just think I'm crazy, I'm openly acknowledging that I might be slowly descending into insanity (I'm *kind of* saying this as a joke though). I even wrote [my own program](https://github.com/ErikBjare/activitywatch) in order to log my computer activities with the accuracy and customization that I wanted (that kind of made them stop laughing at my ""joke"", lol).

I collect data without a specific purpose. I might need it later and if I don't collect it I wont have it. Given that collection is mostly passive (after the right investment in hardware), its a no brainer and you don't have to justify it. 

Of course it's okay to collect data on yourself. And for no reason other than you feel like it. 

That said, collecting data is a pretty clear sign that you're interested in knowing more about yourself. Sure you could wait for an AI to look at your data and tell you things, but you could also use the time you're already putting in to do this yourself.

I'm guessing this is what your friends are picking up on. It's like you've purchased a new chemistry set, opened it and laid out all the pieces, but when people ask what experiments you are going to do, you tell them that you ""just like collecting all the vials"" or you think it ""might be useful"" to have this stuff around one day.

Is it valid to just want to collect data? Sure. However, I'm guessing that what was initially exciting to you about the QS movement wasn't the opportunity to store numbers. It was problably about learning something cool about yourself or making yourself fitter, happier or more efficient. Or contributing to knowledge more generally maybe?

There are just so many cool things one can do when one decides to start studying the self. Just off the top of my head, you could 1) see if the number of steps you take per day is related to your sleep quality, 2) look at the trajectory of your heart rate over time (stable, increasing, decreasing, averages for different times/activities, or 3) try to get a sense of how these variables shift depending on how stressed, happy, etc you are. 


I do for similar reasons. I think it will serve me well in the future as a dataset to review and compare against my metrics later in life. I also think contributing this data anonymously would also have huge research benefits like you're saying. 

I'm curious, which apps or methods do you use to currently track this data? 

^ This!

I know this is an old comment, but today is the first time I have been to this sub. I spent the day earlier looking for ways to increase customization of rescuetime and found your github project via Google, just thought it funny I ran across you twice in one day. I haven't Don anything with your project yet, but plan to look into it. I was primarily looking for a way to collect additional details from focused windows, or support metadata creation via regex title parsing, or a way to trigger integration events alongside activity data. I have high hopes for your code. Don't let me down.

Hah! That was indeed funny.

It's not great, but I think it's a good start if you want to collect raw data, know Python and have some time to spare (might need some love). I use it to collect raw data and it works reasonably well under Linux (writing a module that does the same for Windows or OS X should not be very difficult). If there is anything you find that really bugs you let me know.

Is there an easy way to get blood stats measured on my own or should I go to a doctor each time?Anecdotally, I would recommend 90 days, 30 is a relatively short amount of time to realize anything beneficial.      
As for blood work, what markers do you specifically want to look for? Testing can get expensive, wellnessfx has packages that run from $80 to $1000. Walkinlabs.com is also very good.     
If you know what tests you would like to run, searching for a walk in service lab in your area will probably be your cheapest bet, much cheaper than your doctor will bill you.     

That's helpful.  Do you mean one of those independent stand alone labs where you get drug tests done?

90 days it is.  Thanks!

As far as what markers, can you give me any advice?  I'd be VERY interested in either neurotransmitters or precursors (building block?) to neurotransmitters but short of that I guess typical things that would be markers of cardio health?  I could use some advice there.  

Maybe. A walk in service lab is just a basic phlebotomist (the technician who draws your blood) unit that collects your sample and either has it analyzed in their lab or sends it to an outside lab with or without a doctors prescription. Some labs require a MDs perscription. You can just call around and see which ones near you offer the services you want and compare prices. Some hospital labs will also do it. *ALWAYS* ask for pricing up front because some places are shifty and will have ridiculous mark-up fees.        
If you look at the package comparison page on wellnessfx they have a pretty extensive list of blood tests categorized.      
As far as I understand it, any lab that claims they can test for neurotransmitters in either urine or saliva are full of shit and peddling misinformation at best. [Here's](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/bogus-diagnostic-tests/) a summary of why.       
As for cardiovascular health: CRP (tests for proteins linked to CV disease), HDL/LDL, triglycerides, lipid panel, fibrinogen (protein related to blood clotting, heart attacks and stroke, not really required if your under 50 and get an annual blood panel), lipoprotein a (only if you have a family history of heart problems as this is hereditary).      
Besides the normal annual blood tests you should be getting from your doctor. I would also probably get tested for common nutrient deficiencies related to particular diets as well, like omega 3s, b12, and iron for veganism when you come to those.

I promise Compass for android will be out soon after. 
Our communications routines need both versions.
I have yet to see anything that uses low friction on either platform, that's why we built compass!
For what it's worth, Android is going to be cooler because we can get access to more environmental sensor data from droids!

Sounds good. I'll be anticipating excitedly!

Can you provide some info about Compass? I looked at your post history and see references to it but nothing linking to more info or how to get involved! 

If you want to get people excited, I'd recommend including a link whenever you mention it!

Saga user here. I think they stop the development of the app since I'm getting a lot of bugs with connected services and there is no update to fix them. Also, I think Aro (the company besides the app) is dead.

Another alternatives are:

- Step Journal 

- Moves + Gyrosco.pe  

- Google Maps Location History

- Foursquare + IFTTT + Evernote

I've started to use zenobase with data from sleepcloud (sleep efficiency) and google fit (heart rate). I wanted to create a scatter plot with the correlation between the heart rate during the night and sleep efficiency. But I don't know how to do advanced filtering and the zenobase website doesn't offer too much info in this regard (or my google skills are not that good :) ). 

I'm able to set the simple filters for the scatter plot: tag:Heart Rate and tag:sleep but the results returns the correlation between the avg. heart rate during the previous day and the sleep efficiency. I would like to add another filter to the heart rate data, in simple words that would be: ""the average heart rare during the sleep period"". Is that possible?

Thanks in advance!You can't do ""average heart rate during the sleep period"" (yet), but ""average heart rate between midnight and 6am"" is `tag:Heart Rate|timestamp.hour_of_day:[0..6]`. The filter expression syntax is described in the [API docs](https://zenobase.com/#/api/constraints).

Thanks!! It works like that. I've found also another way in the meantime, as sleep cloud is connected to google fit I can find all the information I need in just one bucket and create the a simple scoreboard with the tags (sleep, still, in vechicle etc).
Then, for the scatter plot, I've added the tag:Sleeping (Fit tag) for frequency in bpm and tag: sleep (sleepcloud tag) for percentage (sleep effciency).

I did this for years.  I moved to a MUSE headset with a 7.99 app I can promise you it's the only way to go. 

I tried the ""guided meditation"" experience today and experience was quite good. Breathing feedback really works well for me. 

I wonder if it's useful to have live HR be fed back into audio (if the timelag isn't too great)

followup on this- I got the MUSE and it is exactly as you say- makes a big difference in my meditation practice.

However, have you tried coherence training with the emwave2 or similar device/apps?

How do they compare?

Thanks. It's a bit expensive, but will put it on my backlog.


Also, what's the best place to report bugs? there a few screens where the flow switched randomly

The live HR back into audio is an interesting concept. How do you picture that working?

Re: bugs - there is a feedback box within the Settings (found on the home page) for submitting bugs or any other feedback. Cheers

Thanks. I envisioned some sort of audio that corresponded to either the heart rate or heart rate variability (like a pulsing sound).

Background to this question- I have a HRV monitor I use every morning, and a HR strap I use when i care about HR when exercising- is there any benefit to tracking HR in non-exercise periods with something like Fitbit Charge HR?

===Conclusions from answers so far:====
A wristbased HR sensor will not be of use to me, because
- resting HR is useful, but only really on a day-timescale (not minute by minute). I already get a daily HRV measurement
- wrist based HR sensors measure pulse, not heart rate anyways
- I already use a polar h7 for when I do need minute by minute HR tracking, which is to say, when I exercise.The thing is that wrist worn trackers measure **pulse** not heart rate. Pulse is a result of heart rate, so measuring pulse is sort of like trying to track the movements and speed of a boat by looking at the water skier behind the boat.

Now, whether it's useful completely depends on what you want to do and how advanced data you need. I would say that aggregated data on average heart rate during an average day, together with resting heart rate, may be useful. Not in everyday life, but if/when it starts to differ from the norm. For example, when your resting heart rate increases by 10 bpm, you most likely have a cold that you'll start feeling in a day or so. This allows you to plan ahead (it's too late to do anything about the cold at this point). 

Maybe resting HR. But if you're measuring HRV with a strap then you should be getting that already (and a whole lot more) anyway


> when your resting heart rate increases by 10 bpm, you most likely have a cold that you'll start feeling in a day or so.

Such an increase can also be due to a change in the environment: For example, the room temperature might have been higher than what you are used to!


I like wrist-based heart rate tracking for measuring my energy expenditure. I cycle everywhere and a pedometer doesn't measure cycling well (or at all). The wrist-based heart rate monitoring proves a significant benefit, since I'm not going to wear a strap for a 15 minute commute. 

cool. My conclusion from this is that getting a wristbased HR sensor will not be of use to me, given that I already measure HRV daily, and use a strap when I exercise.

I don't like wearing a HR strap for extended periods of time, so I only get resting HR at beginning of exercise sessions

I'm measure HRV using the ithelete finger sensor, which is only once a day, but that should be capturing a mostly complete picture of my recovery right?

I know that heat (and sometimes cold) can increase the heart rate, but would a reasonable increase, say from normal 21°C to 25°C have that much influence (10 bmp/min) on heart rate in a health adult? I have to look at it if we get another heat wave in Sweden, as my bedroom tends to get to about 24°C when it's really warm outside.

HRV & HR are great indicators of recovery and once a day is fine. There are other metrics to go alongside HRV that can hone it in even further (like fluctuations in bodyweight), but we're still researching the details of applying these (we as in Elite HRV).

Noticed an increase of 10 bpm with the current heat wave in Seattle (temperatures at night are 25-30°C instead of 15-20°C), but that's just for one n :-) Is HR data from wrist-based trackers useful?

I've been using quantified self tracking apps for some time now, and finally purchased a heart rate monitor: Polar H7.

I would like to be able to do 2 things with my Polar H7 and Nexus 5 and I could not find an easy way to do so. I thought that maybe someone here could help me with this :)
I would like to be able to perform continuous monitoring for periods of a few hours while I am watching a movie, or working for example. I could not find an app that allows me to do so. If the app allows me to then upload the data to Google Fit or Jawbone UP, even better :)

Perform random checks during the day: Put the Polar H7 on, add a tag or two, perform a measurement. Again, if I can then upload the data to Google Fit or Jawbone UP that would be even better :)

If you have any idea how I could do this using the device I currently have,
please let me know,

Thank you!Could use an app like [Polar Beat](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.polar.beat) or [Under Armour Record](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ua.record) to record movie watching sessions as ""indoor"" activities. Both apps connect to Google Fit.

For short tests, something like [Marco Altini's HRV4Training app](http://www.marcoaltini.com/blog/hrv4training-app-details) would be ideal (unfortunately this app is iOS-only). Polar Beat has a ""fitness test"" add-on, but no way to export the test results. If anyone wants to write their own app, [here is some code](https://github.com/zenobase/zenobase-cardio) that could be used as a starting point.

The easiest way is apple watch, no patch, export health kit via QS tool to spreadsheet. 

That's great ! However I am not sure that I have enough skill to work on that app...
I will try to use Polar Beat for now. I still hope to discover an app allowing me to have on a same graph my steps, calories, heartbeat from Polar H7, sleep data from Sleep as Android and location data... That would help me get some meaning out of the data, else, it is just a bunch of graphs in different apps without any real connection between them...
Thanks !

Great post!
Maybe this goes without saying but in addition to the Quantified Self forum there is the Quantified Self blog (http://quantifiedself.com/)
I also like to look for anything Nicholas Felton's done (feltron.com).

There's got to be something out there, right?

Thanks for the suggestions!

I'm looking for a QS web or Android app that can:

1. Import data from other services (such as the auto logging tools on Android) (Nice to have)
2. Allow me to manually input custom trackers (Must have) with several different tracking options (numbers, yes/no, etc)
3. Allow good reporting, ideally I'd like to visualise patterns, something a little more sophisticated than just charts
4. Ability to receive emailed questions or similar to pull in data (nice to have)

I'm happy to have two tools, one to add the data and another to analyse them.

What's the closest tool? I was testing i.strive.to today but the reporting was horrible. Also tried askmeevery which allows you to ask questions and then connect the data to statwing but statwing want 50/month which even they recommend for something higher than personal use.

Thanks heaps!Zenobase imports data from Google Fit (if that's what you mean by ""auto logging""), and you can manually input custom data (either via the Web UI, via a 3rd party logging app like Trackthisforme, or via the Web API).

Data visualization is limited to the basic chart types you need for filtering and comparing your data, but you can export your data as CSV if you want to plot it with a tool like Tableau.

Zenobase integrates with the Reporter app (iOS) for collecting data via random prompts. Currently looking at PACO (Android), and happy to support other services (provided they have an API or data export).

I'll also suggest www.sherbit.io because it provides beautiful visualizations and can compare your QS metrics between apps to form useful conclusions.

**What is this?**

* A simple way to just start tracking daily activities and most important tasks and get some feedback out of it.

* There are 4 custom categories, some (very simple) sleep deficit tracking and 3 most important tasks.

* You can assign points for each task on row 6 and for each category a daily score will be calculated

* Bonus: [graph](http://imgur.com/mvwE9QE)

**How to use**

* Fields A to K have formulas and have to be dragged down when adding a new entry.

* To add new columns in a category just insert a new column but make sure it's added inside the category and not at the extremes of it. For example to add one to AAA, adding it between O and P would be ok. Adding it between P and Q would break the formulas.

* Anyone tried it? Would love to hear your thoughts. Sorry just used an unusual acronym for non transpersonal psych people. SoC = states of consciousness

Yeah I've used the neurosky and some third party apps for it. It's pretty distracting and not very helpful. If anything, however, I like have a consumer available EEG to validate some of the AVS and stim devices I use to induce SoCs. 

I've used Melon, the Bluetooth EEG gizmo from Kickstarter. Either it's not very accurate, or I'm a Zen monk, because it thinks I can hit a high concentration level in seconds. There are games that come with it, but they're basic memory games and are not influenced by the headset. I was hoping it would teach me something - preferably how to relax, like those old 80s biofeedback systems - but no such luck. 

Full disclaimer: I haven't used it for months, so there might have been a massive software update I'm not aware of. 

Tested the Muse, and the data looked plausible (but YMMV). The Muse is a convenient way to keep track of meditation sessions together with some kind of objective score, which would be great for QS experiments. Drawbacks are no data export (or API) for their ""Calm"" app, and the price seems too high.

I've been using a Muse for every day for the last three months.  I really enjoy it.  I'm not a meditation expert.  I've only dabbled in the past.

I've been building Nomie for 10 months now. Track 106 things in my life and have around 20,000 data points. /r/nomie

Should be out of closed beta in the next month. 

To the OP: our iOS app www.sherbit.io is capable of visualizing several of the services you already use (up to 3 at a time) and determining trends. Obligatory self-promotion, I work for Sherbit. The app is out in under a month (:

I really like Habit RPG (habit gamification). It is not really a tracking tool but can used as one sense it has downloadable metrics. Also its awesome!

Check it out at their website: www.habitrpg.com

* Fitbit: Exercise, Steps, Sleep, Water
* MyFitnessPal: Food, Calories, Micronutrients, Macronutrients
* Excel: Lifts, WODs, Run times

I'm currently experimenting with extracting data from HealthKit (not an easy task), parsing it out, and importing it into Splunk, so I can start playing around with correlative analytics (I haven't gotten very far with it - I'm still playing around with parsing the HealthKit exports, and it's lower priority at the moment).

Cool. What led you to google docs as opposed to myfitnesspal?

I'm already signed up - excited to try it!

Under a month.... it says 28 days ago now...
Was anyone able to try the beta ? How is it ?

I can help with that! I've already wrote a pretty good exporter for healthkit, just need to know what format you want it in

Do you have an opinion on https://www.sherbit.io/ ?
It looks great if it delivers. 


Yeah I was doing much the same, but just got overwhelmed with all the digital ""stuff"". 

Ha! I get asked for opinions on services all the time.  I think any service that is trying to empower people to a great level of awareness is a good thing.  While I don't know much about Sherbit or their team, they have tweeted about me, and my biz dev guy loves their blog! 

I'm amazed there isn't a company pulling all this together in a single service. It would be like the future gave birth to a health company. Imagine the app noting that you don't sleep if you drink X amount of coffee past X time and warning you the next day at that time not to drink coffee. Or if it noticed I was irritable on days I did not meditate and reminded me of that fact. Perhaps Google will do this. 

I'm also looking forward to your app existence 

There are several services that have tried doing this, but the results aren't great. The data simply isn't comprehensive enough to make useful predictions at the individual level.

It makes better sense to focus on a specific issue (see e.g. Sleepio), or to simply provide a tool that lets people do their own analysis (which is what we focus on).

What tool did you build? Link? Interested in learning more. Thanks!

There are quite a few apps and devices for sleep tracking. Few are accurate enough to distinguish sleep phases etc, but even a record of what time you went to bed and got up (plus a subjective rating) can be useful, too.

The Moves app is a convenient way to track where you were when, and how much time you spent (incl in ""transport""). If you drive, Automatic can collect additional data (incl some basic driving behavior).

You could try Tactick.com for quantifying routines. I just started trying it out myself. It's too early for me to say whether it is useful.

Download the Sleep Cycle app. It's a great way to start tracking your sleep quality. It'll track your movements and calculate the best time to wake you up based on what part of the sleep cycle you're in. Not to mention you can create your own ""Sleep Notes"" that you can checkmark each time before you go to bed (i.e. Exercised past 6pm, Drank caffeine past noon, etc). Over time you'll be able to see how these things affect your quality of sleep.

I'd like to track the following factors and also to figure out how they all interrelate and affect each other over time to impact overall mental states. I don't know which tool would be best suited for this task. Suggestions?

* Sleep amount/timing/quality
* Social/family influences
* Food/drink/supplements
* Exercise/sex/activity level
* Physiological effects (e.g. cold, hot, comfortable, etc)
* General health (e.g. cough, headache, etc)
* Meditation and type
* Workload/type of work
* Perceived focus/clarity/flow/motivation/energy/mood
* Time of day/week/month of any of the aboveToo many variables! You should already have a hunch of what affects your mind; do experiments to verify specific suspicions, e.g. introduce (or increase) meditation sessions and try to keep everything else as unchanged as possible.

Some data can be captured more or less automatically (e.g. activity, sleep), other data you'll have to log manually (e.g. supplements, headaches). Consider using a general-purpose logging app for manual logging, rather than having a dozen different, specialized apps.

**ShrewdSimian**,

I've been considering the same problem for about a year now: what factors causally influence our performance? Mental state (clarity, focus, energy), physical state, and mood are key performance goals that I'd personally like to optimize for. To my surprise, you've created a list of factors that is very close to my original list.

**zenobase** touched on the problem of confounding variables in experimentation. If only we could relive the same day over, modulating one variable while holding all others fixed, we could determine the impact that this variable has on our performance. In practice, it's so difficult to achieve this, and have been spending a good amount of time trying to design a system to solve this problem.

Ultimately, we are performing self-experimentation, and run into the same challenges that are encountered when scientific experiments are run. We seek to learn about causation while avoiding spurious relationships. 

We also face the challenge of grading subjective experiences while the very process of grading is changing over time: how does your 7/10 happiness today compare to a 7/10 rating five years ago? Your definitions of ""average"" and ""fantastic"" will change over time as your perception adapts to changing norms.

I believe we're at a fantastic time in history for self-monitoring and discovery, and this is just the beginning. It's been said that the doctor of today is ""Dr. Google"", and this goes beyond diagnosis by Google; it applies more generally to the application of machine learning to self improvement and optimization.

Increasing the number of variables is nearly always better for exploratory research of loosely defined questions (within reason of course). Here's a potential solution for the analysis:  
  
I would approach this first with a '[parallel coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates)' plot ([Example 1](http://exposedata.com/parallel/), [Example 2](http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/raw/2499356/)) as a qualitative assessment of the dataset. Lots of ways to do this, but I'd recommend [d3.js](https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/) for interactive data exploration.
  
For a quantitative approach (assuming data is aggregated, organized, etc.), I'd go with a principal component analysis ([PCA](http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/)). Here's a nice R app for cut-and-paste PCA ([Link](http://spark.rstudio.com/mizumot88/pca/)).  

Few other tips:  
 
* Any apps/devices used for data collection should also provide an option for data export. 
* Unless you already know how to determine geospatial or temporal bins for your data, its probably easiest to exclude these dimensions from your analysis. 

This does something similar to what you are trying to measure, but with different variables.

http://www.trackyourhappiness.org/

I have a pretty good hunch, yes, but there seem to be so many factors which can change what I thought. One day I could respond completely different to a medication or supplement than I did the day before.

For instance, suppose I take 500mg of Rhodiola Rosea one day and feel fantastic and I'm on point, then the next day I can barely function after I take it. This happens all too frequently with just about anything I eat, drink or supplement with. Even if I ate the same thing and took the same supplements, so something else must be a hidden factor.

There is clearly some strange hypersensitivity to biochemical imbalances in my genes. Promethease+23andMe was helpful, but incomplete, so I'm still searching for answers. Pending some further elucidation into that, I want to figure out what is causing this mysterious swapping of synergy and discord in my everyday life. :)

Have tried Daytum, but there is very little ""how-to"" information on optimally setting it up.

linear regression can handle this many variables.  just have to remember to test for multicollinearity.  

The hope with finding the right tool to track everything is that over a long enough period of time enough data will come in to cut through the noise.

Subjective experiences can be made less subjective by comparing against a secondary measurement system. For instance, I track every single waking moment of my life using Klok. I know what days/weeks/etc I spent time on what task and so I can get a much less objective measure of what I actually accomplished during a given week. If a week was higher/lower than the previous on the list of accomplishments, higher on vices, etc then I can tell something I did threw off the results...but what that was isn't always within clear just by tracking time and tasks.

Let me know when you come up with such a system to effectively track so many variables, BTW!

Thanks, I'm going to try to adapt this to my analysis goals.

Tracking down causal relationships can be a huge challenge. Your chances are much better if you have a theory you can test; life is too short to follow random correlations that lead down blind alleys.

Any app that lets you quickly log data with a proper timestamp (incl your current timezone offset, if you ever travel) and export the data for analysis should do. Haven't used Daytum much, but other options are Trackthisforme, TapLog, Nomie, and rTracker.

You'll need to get your hands dirty to analyze your data, don't know of any app that can automate that for you (though there are several tools that can help, including our service).


> linear regression can handle this many variables.

Linear regression has its uses, just keep in mind that there isn't much that's linear about how the human body works...

Once you have enough data to cut through the noise, you'll discover correlations. At that point, you can formulate hypotheses to test!

Most excellent! Those are some good options and I will def see if I can make one of them work for me.

Zenobase have an Android app?

there isn't much that's linear about quite a few things that we use linear regression to study.  that doesn't mean we shouldn't use it.  ""all models are broken, some are useful"" said someone.  A few nonlinear systems from which useful insight has been gleaned by using linear regression: politics, the environment, epidemiology.  almost no system at its most fundamental is ""linear"".

It should be wearable on the wrist.

Maybe someone in here uses a heart tracking device for a similar purpose? If you got any advice or read anything about a device (?!) which could help me I would appreciate it very much!

I'm aware that if I want a real medical quality device I would have to pay very much for it, but I just wanted to ask if someone gained experience in tracking the heart rate, not only to keep track of your daily activity but rather in a medical way.Look at the AmpStrip (though I'm not sure you'll be able to buy one until summer).

However, there are too many options and they all seem too promising for me to figure out which is the best for each of the following:
    

1. Heart rate throughout the day (doesn't have to  be incredibly accurate, but consistency in its inaccuracy is a plus)

2. Heart rate during activity (the more accurate and less likely to fall off/get in the way of weightlifting the better)

3. Sleep. I'd prefer something that automatically detects I'm asleep. However, if the best trackers are not wearables, I'm fine with setting them up. It has to be able to work with multiple people in the same bed. 

4. Weight. I'm leaning toward the Fitbit aria because it would be nice to have weight and bf% automatically recorded
5. General activity tracking (steps taken, stairs climbed, steps run, time spent being active)
6. Something like an eeg (not continuous)

Other requirements: For all of these, I would like to be able to retrieve my data. I'd like to have only one device on my wrist at a time. I also prefer a screen over having to pull out my phone.

Other questions:
Is there an appreciable difference in sleep tracking quality between the UP3 and the Fitbit charge hr (that is, does the UP3 actually track different stages accurately and is that something worth measuring)? How do smart watches like the Moto360 and the apple watch compare to, say, the fitbit charge hr for the activity tracking portion? Are there other biometrics I should be measuring and if so, what's best for those measurements?

I'd prefer a single device, but don't mind having more than one if the data is better. I was leaning toward apple watch + some sleep tracker, or fitbit surge (although I don't love it as a smart watch)/ fitbit charge hr by itself to cover some of the above.

ThanksBasis Peak addresses most of your requests. Though it does lose accuracy during activity. You could switch heart rate monitors when working out for something like a Polar chest strap or Body Media armband. 
The Withings scale has some more features than the FitBit Aria, but they're both fairly comparable. 
Zeo Sleep Tracker has some great sensors, it offers a little more detail than the sleep tracking Basis Peak provides. But you might not need both devices, depends on the granularity of data you're looking for. 
And Basis Peak recently came out with an update that lets you download your data. 
Hope that helps! 
(I'm not associated with any of these companies.) 

An AmpStrip might suit for 1 and 2

>Heart rate during activity (the more accurate and less likely to fall off/get in the way of weightlifting the better)

Don't bother with the apple watch, at least not yet:

http://www.mensjournal.com/gear/electronics/my-week-with-the-apple-watch-20150408
Except the optical HRM didn't really seem to do that. Huffing through heavy squats, the Watch read my heart rate as fairly low. And more frenetic CrossFit workouts perplexed it; the Watch couldn't get a read on my second-by-second HR during box jumps, burpees, and pull-ups, and my overall calorie burn and HR seemed off for these ""other""-type training sessions. That's a problem Apple says you can fix by using a heart rate monitor strap and synching it with your Watch.






I use the Fitbit Aria, its part of my routine, and I use the Fitbit.   I have these for years now.  Battery life is great and Fitbit have good integration, including a channel with IF.   I really like the Zeo for sleep tracking but they went bust.  Sad.

Thanks. I've heard great things about the zeo but am hesitant because the company went under. 


How does the basis compare to the fitbit charge and jawbone up? 

I've been looking for something to handle 1-3 plus a silent alarm, which the basis peak doesn't have.  Charge HR has that but doesn't handle HR during workouts as well as the basis peak.  

Where did you see that you can pull data from the basis peak?  All I've heard is that there will be an api available in the future.

Looks like it could be half a year until that ships though. I'd rather have something for the mean time and upgrade as necessary. 

Thanks for bringing it to my attention though 

I don't use either of those devices, so I couldn't say specifically. But, to speak in generalities, Basis has been doing continuous heart rate monitoring longer than the others, so I'd think they know a little bit more about how to do it properly. The Basis also comes with a thermometer and perspirometer (sweat measure), which I don't believe the others have. And the sleep tracking on Basis Peak is better, as I understand it. Or at least the graphs and analysis they provide are better.

You can ask me, BTW. And we will deliver ;-)

So, how does Titanovo avoid the limitations and problems TeloMe ran into?

They didn't run into FDA to the best of my knowledge. As soon as we are not giving medical advises our test is not considered as a medical device. And we are not giving medical advises, because, honestly, no medical advise can be given because of telomere length only. But a lifestyle advice and suggestion by direct comparison to other user - is totally OK.

And as for technology - I am not aware of their technological problems, but there were some obviously. They used Q FISH, we are using qPCR. qPCR is easier, more accurate and reliable. It provides us with mean telomere length and cannot generate data on shortest telomere, but recent studies showed that the role of shortest telomere is highly overestimated. Mean length is a more general and useful data in a long run.

If you give them the data, why wouldn't it be? Are you referring to the Apple Research Kit? Or something else?

If you sign up for the service, purchase the product, log in, connect the tracker, and use it, why shouldn't they be allowed to keep and utilize your data? There are many times during that process that you sign up to hand over the data.

Most companies in this space do let you delete your data (and it's required in the EU), though many will keep (and even share) anonymized and/or aggregated data. If this matters to you, have a look at a service's ToS before handing over your data!

I didn't plan on making it public at first, but if enough people are interested, I'll put more work into it and release it on the app store.

After using spreadsheets for a long time to track all sorts of stuff, I started to look for an app that would make this easier for me. For some reason I didn't really like any of the habit tracking apps out there and I guess I was just used to the spreadsheet feel with the grid an cells, so I made my own app. I've been using it for couple of months now and I'm just interested if anyone would be interested in using something like this.

[Entry, Yes/No](https://dl.orangedox.com/0c2fKiJ7hYpAxdFuIu/entry_yesno.png)


The idea is that it's like a spreadsheet table and you edit entries by just clicking on the cell and each cell has its own data type for simpler entry, like time, Yes/No, number, text, predefined options, etc. Depending on the entry, it turns green of red. And you can add a note to each cell as well. Columns for each day are added automatically and the App icon badge displays number of untracked entries for today.

I'd love to hear your feedback and PM if you want to try out the current version.iOS only, I'm guessing? It's a shame, I've been looking for something like this on android for a while. Looks really tidy, nice and minimalistic.

I see that the wake time has multiple fields - bad/neutral/good, as well as the actual wake time and notes. Is this sort of form entry something a user could customize, or is it built in?

The app icon badge is a good idea, though alerts for when certain data should be entered would be neat as well, and perhaps forms which include multiple data slots to prevent additional tapping back and forth between the spreadsheet view and the entry ones. Those a relatively minor ideas, though, overall this looks like a great general QS app. 

Can we see what's in the menu? Is there option for filtering entries? If I have tens or even hundreds of entries it would be hard to find them quick. This could be done with either predefined groups or simple search field. Preferably both :)

Thanks for the feedback! Yes, currently iOS, but my friend is Android developer and with enough interest for the app, he would love to build an Android version.
You can specify the good/neutral manually for each entry, but the idea is that you could add a condition for each field like ""if wake time is before 8 then good and after 10 bad"" and it would format it automatically.

I saw the first screenshot and thought, ""this is just the tool I've been looking for""! Please make an Android version and I'd use it in an instant.

Customer service is always fairly helpful and they tend to replace it - except the times when a year had passed from purchase.

But I am fed up. The quality control is horrendous. How is this one of the market leaders?! I FEEL LIKE IM TAKING CRAZY PILLS! </rant>

Now that I've calmed down. Having read all the other reviews of the alternatives, I feel like none come close in terms of the app (and smart alarm, my favourite function). Are there any alternatives that I could use and input the data into the Jawbone app?

Thanks so much!You can use a service like fitnesssyncer.com to send data from another supported service to Jawbone, but that won't let you replicate the smart alarm feature.

I miss the smart alarm and nap feature of my Jawbone UP but the hardware is so unreliable. You could use the Jawbone app on a Pebble watch. It only tracks steps so far, but I assume sleep is coming.

Yeah, gave up on them after 5 dead bands in 1.5 years. I don't miss it. 

I had pretty much the same experience.  Whenever you have a problem with a band, Jawbone quite happily replaces it with a 'refurbished' one that has a 50/50 chance to be worse than the one you sent them.  

I sent them a mostly working band that lost its button, and they sent me back a band that's battery was so shite that it lasted about two days before needing recharging.

I said screw it and replaced my JawboneUP with a Polar Loop.  It doesn't have the smart alarm function, but I am using an old iPod touch with the Sleep Cycle app to substitute.  

Tried this service, couldn't figure out why importing my sleep into Jawbone app doesn't work.

> fitnesssyncer

This looks great! So I could use (example) fitbit band and jawbone app? That would be perfect.

You could do that, just keep in mind that you'd still need to use the Fitbit app to get data off the device, and there would be a bit of a delay before data would show up in the Jawbone app. Also, not sure if they sync minute-resolution data, or just daily summary data.

But they're competing for my money and heart rate tracking during the day and sleep cycles are the important variables for me. The extra Apple Watch features sound pretty nice to me. I have the 6+ and hate getting it out to check notifications, especially when wearing winter clothes where jackets and mittens get in the way.

The release of the UP3 is so late now I'm considering just waiting for the Apple Watch and see the first reviews and reactions to it. I'm wondering if more people feel the same, or not. And share you insights on this. It's not clear if the Apple Watch will do 24/7 heart rate tracking, and it looks like it won't have any sleep tracking features, either. But wait and see is always a good strategy :-)


TLDR: UP3 if it comes out will outclass all optical wrist worn heart rate monitors especially if you don't have fair skin. 

I think a key difference here is that the UP3, if and when it gets released, uses a superior heart tracking technology. Optical heart rate monitoring (the green lights on the back of all current wrist work heart rate monitors) is just not very accurate. Movement will make it loose it's ability to track. It also has a hard time reading through the skin of people with darker complexion. The Up3 uses Bio-Impedence and it doesn't care if your black/white/purple/hairy or whatever. This method is also much more upgradeable in that as long as the sensor is working firmware can make it better. It has also been shown to be useful for a lot of other health markers. Unfortunately, Jawbone is having issues with quality control. On a small scale the bands work. Once they scale up production they don't. This coupled with the fact that they have had some financial issues is not allowing them to manufacture. They are currently looking for funding to fix the issue. I love jawbone as a company. I think both the Jawbone and Up24 outclassed every device in their respective generations. I find their app to be the most helpful as well. Unfortunately, due to the delays I may look at getting ""temporarily"" an alternative. But trust,  should Jawbone actually put out the UP3 I will sell what I have for that thing. Ideally we should hear of an update by the time Apple Watch is here. Though, if I were you I may look at other alternatives. The apple watch has less than 24 hr battery life and that's shitty. Even the Microsoft Band had better than that. If you want the Apple Watch for the trend and can blow the money do it. There are reports that Android Wear will come to iOs soon too. So their is even more reason to wait. 

I've bought into [AmpStrip](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ampstrip-comfortable-24-7-heart-rate-wearable) for continuous heart/sleep tracking.  It's set to be released in June, and I'm pretty stoked for it.

I used to use the Basis B1, but stopped using it because it's bulky, provides mediocre data during activity, and all of the data is locked into the Basis ecosystem (ie no third party integration).

You sound like you're looking for a smart watch, which is cool, and totally different than what the AmpStrip is going to provide, but keep one thing in mind--[wrist band based heart rate monitors suck](http://www.cnet.com/news/how-accurate-are-wristband-heart-rate-monitors/) at reporting accurate heart rate data.  This doesn't include the Basis Peak as it wasn't released when this came out, but you should probably stay away from Basis as a whole for ignoring their customer base (myself included) for the past several years when asking about third-party integration, as well as blocking out user-coded attempts to get their own data with platform updates.  They're just after your data, and it seems really dodgy to me.

I love my basis peak's four day battery life and great data.

Check also out the Garmin Vivoactive http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2015/01/vivoactive-smartwatch-vivofit2.html
It packs the usual Garmin watch stuff, with a new framework for apps and it tracks steps, sleep, running, cycling and swimming, lasting a week. 

I loved the Apple Watch when it was announced, but it can't compete if you're looking for a fitness solution. 

I thought the hr was confirmed? I think sleep tracking cloud be a safe assumption due to the fact it has both the accelerometer and hr stuff. But then again, sounds like it needs to be recharged every night so hmm. Not sure anymore. 

The AmpStrip looks great for anyone who cares about useful data. However, they haven't committed themselves to providing an open API, unless they get at least $250K in preorders.

It looks very interesting. I'm not sure about how to wear it though, I'm a bit hesitant to have something stick to my body like that...

Great data, if they let you have it...

I never heard of that one!

Edit: It looks like an interesting contender. I'm going to research this one a bit more!

Does it work with iOS health kit?

I will check it out!

The current product page states that ""the custom heart rate sensor [...] can help gauge your intensity during workouts to improve overall calorie tracking"" and the ""accelerometer measures [...] calculates your calories burned throughout the day."" So based on that, I wouldn't expect continuous heart rate tracking... Perhaps the battery wouldn't make it through a single day if they did? :-)

True, though they're already showing they're more open than Basis by having *some* third party access.  That said, I honestly think they'll get their 250k backing.

Yeah the open API is a dealbreaker. Perhaps they'd have an easier time getting to $250K if they committed to it in the first place. It's not like it's difficult.

Edit: AmpStrip actually reached their $250k goal.

Don't do it!  Unless you want all of your data locked to that Basis platform, *don't* go with it.  I had the Basis B1.  It was a piece of crap at tracking workout (or any activity) heart rate data, and while the Peak has supposedly ""fixed"" this (which I'm taking with a grain of salt), the data thing still bugs me to no end.

They've said they are ""exploring opportunities"" or something like that for third-party API's, but they've been saying that since the B1 was **announced** (going on multiple years now).

**Stay away!**

Shucks. Looks like no healthkit integration so far even planned. Good luck!

Hmm now I not convinced anymore. Luckily the up3 isn't available yet. Would pull the trigger otherwise ;)

I'm trying to help a friend who has trouble sleeping pick a sleep tracker / fitness tracker, and price isn't a concern right now.

In order of importance, this is what she said she hopes for in a device:

* sleep monitor/tracker
* alarm
* motivational
* couch potato warning
* auto daily goals that change based on activity level
* oxygen level
* heart rate

I've personally used a Basis B1 and a BodyMedia Core armband, so I'm most familiar with Jawbone's tech -- and as a personal requirement, automatic sleep mode would be really nice.

Anyone have any suggestions on what ticks the most high ranked boxes?  

Thanks!Personally, I am most excited the upcoming [Vivoactive](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/prod150767.html). It does everything you mention with the exception of oxygen monitoring. I recently bought a Polar M400 which was awesome for the price, but the last iOS app/firmware update broke syncing with my phone. I'm going to return it and wait for this thing. I have always had great luck with Garmin products. I think they will cave and open their API this year, but that could be wishful thinking. 

If the sleep problems are mainly an educational/motivational issue, https://www.sleepio.com/ might be worthwhile (they support both Fitbit and Jawbone).

The main use case for tracking blood oxygen levels (SpO2) is detecting sleep apnea--is that a concern?

Garmin's Vivofit has both a couch potato alert and dynamic goals. However, their API isn't open, so you won't be able to use it with many 3rd party services like Beeminder that could otherwise help with the motivational aspect.


[deleted]

The vivoactive is the one I'll be getting personally -- but my requirements are different. I've been wanting a running watch with passive activity tracking. 

I couldn't find anything about the vivoactive being able to wake you during your lightest phase of sleep -- where did you see/hear that it can handle that?

(Though it looks like its extendable via custom apps, so..?)

Having just been through another discussion with Garmin regarding API access, let's just say you shouldn't hold your breath...

Regrettably, probably not. That's an interesting site, though -- do you know if the site will handle the bodymedia-style galvanic response data from the up3?

Thanks for the reply.  

Possibly. There's talk of sleep studies, but if that's the case, that's outside the scope of these devices. 

The vivofit line seems to hit many of the boxes, but as far as I can tell, misses on alarms, both standard and sleep-cycle aware.. but I say that based on reading marketing materials alone.

I used the Microsoft Band for about a month, and the wrist HR monitoring was pretty lousy.  I hate wearing the strap, but I have pretty much resigned myself to it for a couple of years until the technology improves.  I have read a lot of early reviews of the Fitbit Surge on Amazon/REI.com, and a lot of people are complaining about HR accuracy.  The other thing for me personally is that I workout with kettlebells a lot, and having a really expensive device isn't a great option.  The kbs can easily damage the tracker by smacking into it.  Having the option to take the device off my wrist and still pick up my HR is a pretty nice feature to have.  Just my 2 cents.

Who knows? This would depend on Jawbone making this data available through their API. But even if they don't, the HR and GSR sensors should make the sleep data the UP3 reports more accurate.

I'm size 44 too, I have tried one of them on and it fits me well. The t-shirt is size small, but it should be a tight fit. Have a look at the sizing guide that OMSignal have, based on your chest circumference. I'll try to find the link for you.

Now I understand that apps like endomondo will pull a running heat rate through android wear. Fitbit advantage is altitude, sleep tracking, all day tracking integration with MyFitnessPal, and battery life. Wear advantage is flexibility.

Have any of you faced similar decisions and what had been your experience?The issue with the Fitbit is that it doesn't support the standard BLE HR profile, so you can't connect it directly to another app like Endomondo.

Which Android Wear device are you looking at? Some people find that wristbands aren't accurate enough for tracking heart rate during exercise, so you might find yourself using both a wristband for 24/7 recording, and a chest strap for recording more accurate data during exercise (or for doing resting heart rate & HRV tests)...

Looking at the G Watch R. My issue is that I don't always have my chest strap with me or on. I know the wrist sensor won't be as accurate, but it's better than no sensor.

Fitbit locking me in is a deterrent. I want to use their heart rate data with other apps. I know I can do it with Endomondo on wear, but that lacks sleep tracking and altitude. Also my chest strap is getting old and doesn't hold a charge like it once did, nor does it connect right away or give accurate data at first anymore.

It would be great if there were a Fitbit Wear device. ;P

Some people complain about having no usable data while moving, so it's not just a matter of being inaccurate (i.e. not accurate enough for measuring HRV). But it depends on the device, and on your wrist.

There are apps that can use Android Wear devices to record sleep, see e.g. Sleep as Android.

Doesn't Endomondo record altitude? Other comparable apps like Strava and RunKeeper certainly do.


Endomondo would end my phone's battery in half a day if I used it all day though. I might be willing to forgo the altitude data because the heart rate data captures the intent. The Fitbit has altitude built in for all day recording.

I am concerned that the G watch R won't be able to record heart rate durning intense activity like burpees and sprints, let alone TaeKwondo. The FitBit was made to do it. Then again, if I get a new strap for my chest sensor and stick it out, I could just not use the sensor on the wear for workouts; which puts me close to square one. I don't have tiny wrists, so either should sit well. I didn't know about android sleep. I like the auto tracking of the FitBit, and would think the wear might have something like that. Which might be Sleep as Android.

Apps like Endomondo definitely aren't meant for recording data 24/7, just workout sessions.

Wearing a wristband or watch during Taekwondo practice doesn't sound like a good idea... Something like the [Hexoskin](http://www.hexoskin.com/) or [AmpStrip](http://igg.me/at/ampstrip/x/4038809) would seem more suitable. The AmpStrip could be used 24/7, but is not available yet.

Sleep as Android needs to be told when you go to bed and when you get up. Not sure how well the Fitbit sleep detection works.

I wasn't sure about the wristband for TKD. I wasn't going to spar with it. Just solo punches and kicks. Still sounds like it could fall off. That hexaskin looks awesome though! I didn't know about it.

I've done a little research and found out that th optical HRM options don't respond well to intervals of 30 seconds or so. HRV isn't good. I do sprint intervals and my TKD sessions include intense burst as well as longer repetition.

I guess what I will be doing is using a strap for interval training still and either the Fitbit, the g watch R, or the Mio Link for strength sessions.

I don't know how activity tracking compares between the Fitbit and Mio link though. More research ahead. :)

Please report back if you find a solution that works for you :-)

Will do! I have a Fitbit coming and a new btle chest strap because I found one for 85% off on Amazon. Sports Tracker is the brand. 12 bucks and it's 75 at best buy.

Will use them in conjunction for now and keep an eye on the hexaskin!

I have preordered one and I'm really looking forward to receiving it! My biggest concern is regarding the accuracy of the measuring. I'm a bit worried that it will be way too inaccurate to be of any use. 

See this thread: https://forum.quantifiedself.com/thread-hi-i-am-a-product-designer-for-health-apps (it's about the H2OPal, but the same applies to Vessyl)...

It seems like a lot of work (cleaning it out all the time) to save a little work (writing intake down )

Super clever technology. Wish there were details about how it works. If I had to guess though, it probably has some built in photodiodes and LEDs to measure the transmittance/reflectance of light of whatever liquid is in the cup. Perhaps even a multi spectral approach with LEDs spanning the visible/NIR spectrum. They probably did an extensive amount of machine learning to train and classify the most common liquids this device would be used for- probably super tedious developing this part. 

Too much of a hurdle to be useful for almost everyone.  Similar to the Reporter app, using it will require too much 'cost' on the user.  Having to carry it around, apply it each time, and use it consistently are all major challenges.

dat protein tho

That's my worry too. It looks like a really cool tool in theory, but expensive and totally untested.

So unless you are able to review an app's source code, there's no way around reading the ToS and deciding whether or not to trust the author, cloud or not.

Reporter and Kennedy on iOS both good choices with slightly different ways of getting you to track data. They have the option of backing up your data to services like Dropbox or google Drive but it's not that way by default because the information stays in your device unless you choose to export it. 

Another vote on Reporter (iOS): all data is kept on your device and it can export a CSV or JSON

Also, an older iOS app: FatWatch (log weight/fat) uses only local data and will export a CSV. Bonus: it uses the Hacker's Diet formula for graphs and estimations.

It's this device called the Versus that's designed to improve focus, stress management, impulse control and the speed with which you recover from mistakes, and ultimately help you get into a flow state.  

I'll be posting updates once or twice a month about my progress with it.  Aside from using it for its intended purpose and ultimately writing up a review, I also want to try using it under different conditions to see how that changes my readings- like with a blue light shining in my face, or in darkness, or using it while taking various nootropics. So I'm open to any suggestions people have for me about different tests I could run with it.  

To be clear, it comes with a suite of exercises that you play while wearing it (using a companion iPadd app), so I think the conditions need to be something that can be in place while playing the iPadd games, so nothing like ""take readings while kayaking"" or anything like that.  Anyway, I'm open to suggestions, and if anyone's interested in following along, you can read about in on [my blog,](http://johnfawkes.com/becoming-superhuman-through-diy-brain-scanning/) join my mailing list (I'll send out updates about 2-3 times a month), or just check in a month or two and see what I've posted to reddit about it.

Is there a way for me to keep track of his stats? On the Jawbone you can add people to your 'team', but as he will be on a different band, I am wondering if there is a third party consolidator or something similar?

Try Matchup: https://matchup.io/

I'll second the recommendation for Matchup.io, or perhaps EveryMove. If you want to track more than points derived from step counts (e.g. sleep), and plan to put a bit more effort into the analysis, we support both Jawbone and Misfit.

I'm kinda curious about how this is going to go, so I'm thinking of buying a fitness tracker, primarily for sleep tracking. I'm thinking the Jawbone Up24, because the vibrating alarm feature sounds useful. Is there something different I should be considering?Congrats on fatherhood. I'm a merely weeks away myself. 

You have a variety of options - some that exist now, and some that are right around the corner. The UP24 is a nice wearable, but the UP3 is scheduled to be released this year, and it will up the ante on a number of features including sleep monitoring. It is said to include the ability to sense not only deep sleep and light sleep, but also REM sleep. I personally love the Jawbone user interface. I think the app is really slick, though I use the Fitbit system right now primarily because that's what my entire family uses, and that is important to me (challenges, competitive stuff, etc.). A device's ecosystem can be fun. 

Besides the UP platform, your other options are the Basis Peak, the Fitbit line of products, and the Microsoft Band. The Basis is a fine device, but not for me really. I was looking for something that has accurate heart rate tracking when I owned a Basis, and anything more than very light activity (i.e. walking) would yield crazy inaccurate results. As for the Fitbit line, they have the following products out right now (that include sleep tracking capabilities) and scheduled to come out: 

**Fitbit One**: The 'belt clip' fitbit, if you don't like wearing a bracelet during the day. This is a remarkable pedometer, and a pretty good sleep tracker. At night, it can be worn in a (supplied) velcro armband that you're supposed to wear on your wrist. The armband has a little pocket in it, into which you put the Fitbit One. 

**Fitbit Charge**: Bracelet device, just came out. Does mostly what the Fitbit One does, but on your bracelet instead of the pedometer-style of the One.

**Fitbit Charge HR**: Comes out ""early 2015,"" same as above but includes a small screen for basic phone notifications and device metrics. The ""HR"" is thrown into the name because it uses optical sensors to capture heart rate. 

**Fitbit Surge**: Also comes out ""early 2015,"" a bit larger, can do all of the above, shows more notifications, and is frankly designed to be more of a fitness smartwatch.

All the Fitbit marketing stuff, UI, screenshots, etc. can easily be found through google and YouTube.

Then there's the Microsoft Band, which just came out a couple weeks ago. It is built with quite a few sensors, includes sleep tracking capabilities and phone notifications, is cross-platform, has amazing Windows Phone integration, but is a first-generation device. Not necessary a bad thing, the Band looks awesome, but I suspect near-future versions will yield a more physically desirable design. No offense to anyone who bought a Band - I wish I could afford one right now. 

Another thing you might be interested in is exporting data to a spreadsheet either manually or through an IFTTT ""recipe."" I've already written a wall of text so I won't belabor the topic anymore, but there's lots of good info on web about this.

tl;dr: UP24 is cool. UP3 is (most likely) going to be cooler, and is weeks away. Fitbit has good equipment and UI too. Research the user interfaces of these, including the sleep tracking user interfaces. Get your friends and family to buy whatever you get into - comparing steps etc. is a lot of fun. And again congratulations on the baby. 






Something important to note is how you want to track your sleep. Different trackers have different approaches, for instance:

Fitbit makes you manually start and stop sleep mode by pressing a button on the wristband. Gives you more control but can take a while to get into the habit of remembering to do this. I sometimes go out for a walk in the morning with sleep mode still running.

Jawbone requires you to start sleep mode manually but automatically turns it off for you when it detects movement. Sounds more convenient but can be a lot less accurate, depending on your sleep patterns. I often find I'm in the kitchen making a coffee and my UP is still in sleep mode. Even more often, getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night often makes the UP jump out of sleep mode, so it thinks my average wake time is 3am. If you're planning to wear your tracker after the baby comes, that could be an issue if you're getting up a lot during the night.

Misfit Shine automatically detects sleep based on your movement so you don't have to start or stop it. It's not perfect, but I've found it to be accurate enough most of the time.

From my experience wearing a Fitbit Force, original Jawbone UP, Jawbone UP24, Withings Pulse and Misfit Shine, I've found that most of the bands struggle with sleep patterns that include a lot of waking/getting up during the night, except the ones like Fitbit that are explicit, and won't stop sleep mode until you tell them to.

Hey Zeus, 

I think there's been a lot of good discussion here and I'd like to add to the list. There's a few interesting sleep-specific tracking devices that are coming to market really soon. The big difference with these newer products is they don't require you to wear anything and I believe they integrate with other smart devices as well.  

Here's the short list: 

lunasleep.com 
cubesensors.com 
sleepcycle.com 

Hope this helps!

Inferring sleep phases from accelerometer data is questionable, though it seems to work for some people. Devices that record additional data like heart rate and skin temperature (e.g. the Basis) are a bit better.

Of course even just keeping track of when you were in bed (vs actually sleeping) can be quite valuable. Two devices that track that reliably and without manual intervention are the BodyMedia FIT (no longer available?) and the Beddit (in theory, haven't tested).

Chrona just launched on Kickstarter.  It is more than a sleep tracker, and probably perfect for a new father!  Chrona uses sounds to manipulate and optimize your sleep cycle for better sleep.  Chrona can actually hack your sleep for you so that you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to go.  Check it out here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ultradia/chrona-sleep-smarter-not-longer?ref=nav_search

I've had the basis peak for a week now and I love it. Very good reviews on accuracy. Improvements over old models.

Cool, thanks for the detailed writeup! I have a few months to go yet, so I figured if I started now I could get a good baseline. I saw the UP3, but figured it was a little expensive for something that may or may not take to my daily routine. 

I'm no stranger to messing with data, and I did see that you can export the UP data to CSV, and that's a bonus.  

Congrats to you too, good luck with your own wee one!

You can still buy the BodyMedia fit. I know someone who bought it a month ago. They do have some shipping issues -- sometimes they would just delay the shipping with a few weeks.

I love the BodyMedia because it automatically detects sleep, even though it does not have sleep phase detection. The downside is -- doesn't have vibrating alarm which I consider really useful.

One thing to be aware about the vibrating alarm -- it can also wake up your partner. My wife frequently reports that.

The UP is a great platform. If you wind up with an UP24 I'm sure you won't be disappointed. And keep in mind if you buy it from them, you get a 60-day money back guarantee, so if you get the UP24 you can always return it if for some reason the UP3 just blows you away when it comes out next month.

Some of the things I've changed:

* The formulas in the percentage conversion tab are a little longer but now there's not a million different cells needed to calculate these (I didn't break the formula up into different cells this time).
* Each variable has its own tab now for it's specific breakdowns. Formerly, it was all on one tab. This makes it easier to see and more pleasing to the eye.
* Adding new eras under each variable in the Setup tab is much easier now because the Data Validation in the Data Entry tab now covers all the empty spaces. Now the user doesn't have to mess around with Data Validation unless they exceed the number of cells I already provided.
* In the Data Entry tab, the ""year"" column autopopulates after you enter in the new year in January.
* In the Dashboard tab, I've added a column for w/l streak as well as the cumulative win/loss and cumulative win percentage column.

It would also be nice to track sleep quality. I figure an activity tracker is the right tool, but maybe there are also smartwatches that can do this?

I would prefer strong privacy and having access to my data as csv or json. I'm running android on my smartphone.

Any ideas?I've worn the Fitbit Force, Jawbone UP original and 24, Withings Pulse, and Misfit Shine. The best was the Fitbit Force, so I'd recommend waiting for the Fitbit Charge to arrive, which is basically an updated Force. 

I've also collected a bunch of reviews and comparisons of trackers that might be useful to you: https://exist.io/blog/fitness-tracker-reviews/

I would avoid BASIS and their products as much as possible at this point. 

They have been promising an API, access to data, and integration with third party apps for years and have been shit at communicating what is going on and why it is taking so long. I am beyond being willing to accept any excuses. They are even launching a new and improved product, which still does not say anything about an API besides ""soon"". 

That said, if I were going to get another one I would probably wait for the new Fitbit to come out. 

https://www.fitbit.com/purepulse

It has all of the typical nifty activity tracker stuff as well as heart rate AND GPS. 

As far as I have been able to tell, feature wise, this one is probably going to be out in front feature wise for this generation of fitness trackers. 

New Jawbone Up3 looks good.

Can you elaborate what you mean by ""strong"" privacy?

Do you need a separate device, or would a mobile app do?

Fitbit has an ""idle alert' feature, which may be what you are looking for.

To get a reasonable estimate of sleep quality, the device should track heart rate, like the Basis.

Both Jawbone and Fitbit give you access to detailed data in json through their APIs (in the case of Fitbit, you have to ask for permission to get access to the detailed data).

According to Wirecutter, the Garmin Vivo has inactivity warnings.  You can also install Eyeleo on your laptop.

The fitbit line has been rock solid for me, and their newest devices look even better. The device I'm super curious about is the basis peak. It looks like it collects a bunch of data from it's seven sensors, but it's a little awkward looking from the online pictures.

Fitbit is arguably less of a walled garden than Apple Health: Fitbit has an open API that any developer can integrate with or build tools for (e.g. to export data in a more useful manner). Apple Health on the other hand can only be accessed from inside the walled garden, i.e. through an iOS app. This requires that you join their $100 per year developer program, and use OSX developer tools...

I have my Fitbit account connected to HealthVault. From there I can easily export all I want at no cost.

Same goes for Basis. At least you can get your data out with some kind of official method.  Basis you're completely hooped other than some user written set of scripts that breaks with every Basis update.

Interesting, that's something worth checking out but I think the post is saying there's not a user friendly way. How many users do you realistically expect to go through that process?

Really? I will check this out. I have a health vault but didn't see this

But the third party developers can build any user friendly application to access that data, can't they? You can download the data with premium account, or access the API - seems fair to me.

Yeah, sorry about that. That post and method are pretty old. It still works and we've even extended it to include minute-by-minute data, but yes, you do have to do a bit of work. On the plus side the data is passed directly to you so you don't have to authenticate any 3rd parties.

the data consists of: Exact time, and  partial location data. Not all peeing events have a Geo location. What prompted you to start tracking your peeing habit (err, addiction? :p )?  Perhaps that might lend itself to what you could do with the data...

[removed]

There are a couple tracking methods you could potentially implement.  As it sounds, you are currently tracking location and duration.  Using location, you can determine frequency of location (ie. where you pee most often and which urinals/toilets you use most often).  

Duration is an interesting metric to track.  You could potential use the data to develop a hypothesis about prostate health and bladder function.  Combined with volume data you can determine flow rate.

Urine output is usually collection over a 24 hour period in healthcare settings in combination with input data (ie water consumption/IV input).  It would be useful to know your water/moisture input over the same period.

Other useful data would be urinalysis data using a dipstick.  This would help determine the content and qualitative data of the urine.

You need your food consumption to figure out type of food/drink and how long it takes to leave your system.  I did something like this to figure out how late I could drink and not get up in the middle of the night. 

Track the decline in your prostate's health if you have one.

how many times a day is your average?

How do you record this data, in a spreadsheet, or using a general-purpose tracking app?

Out of curiousity, what exactly do you track with respect to your peeing habits?   Easiest, I presume, would be the time of each pee and perhaps the duration?  From duration I presume you could deduce volume?  

I ask because I've been wanting to track urination mostly for weight tracking (coupled with water consumption), but haven't figured out the best way to determine how -much- (in volume, and hence, weight) I'm peeing.

Source that quote: ""What's this?  It looks like you've circled all the public restrooms...and rated them from one to five stars.""  

I track a lot of things. Peeing is the one I used to start the habit of tracking behavior

Drinking water, coffee, alcohol and 30 other points. 

And thanks for the tip on the test strips!

No glucose or ketones go into your urine unless you have diabetes.

What did you find out?


8.5

An app I've been building over the last few months - that  I'm actively trying to commercialize - called Nomie 

I only use it to track when and where it happens. But you could tap ounces for starring and then one tap when you stop - and get your duration that way. (Less than optimal)

Or, Someone should invent a pee measuring device that slides over the sausage before you pee. 

Thats not true,  people on the ketogenic diet often measure the ketones in their urine to determine if they are in the state of ketosis that they are attempting to achieve.

Of course! It's on my phone, but I haven't started using it for anything yet.

* Moves - best location tracking app out there, imo. It's simple, elegant, and integrates with Fluxtream and other services nicely. Alternatives: Saga (it's nice because you can add visits or travel in between the ones it automatically logs, a feature the other apps don't implement), Chronos (great because it emails you weekly infographics about your movements), Google Location tracking (low battery consumption, improves Google's services for you, but the data isn't readily available and doesn't really play well with other services--you have to manually download the data via Google Takeout and then import the data into whatever analytic/mapping software/service you use; but it's really simple because you don't have to download a new app you just have to opt into the service). 
* My Tracks - it's a pretty great app to track more detailed location data. Moves (and Saga, Chronos, et al) do a pretty good job of keeping track of high level information (like what building was I in at what times). My Tracks gives more detailed information but on a more limited use. You would use it to keep track of a run, hike, drive, or any other short trek. It then provides way more detailed information about speed, altitude, distance, etc. It's a little more narrow in scope, and you have to manually start and stop recording; but it's pretty good for what it does.
* RunKeeper - along the same lines as My Tracks, but more for fitness related activities. My Tracks is more general purpose.  
* Daily Roads Voyager - if you want to capture video or images about commutes or drives, this is a pretty good tool for that. Not strictly lifelogging, unless you spend most of your time driving maybe. 
* AIRS/Storica - your phone has a lot of sensors built into it, especially if it's one of the newer devices. AIRS is an app that runs in the background and records information from these sensors. Storica is used to analyze and display the information recorded in AIRS. There is also some way to export the AIRS data to your computer, but I don't remember where I saw that or how to do it. 
* Trackerfy - logs how you use your phone, how much time you spend on what apps, etc.
* Battery Monitor Widget - pretty good battery life tracking app. It has some pretty detailed settings to get accurate information about your specific battery/phone. It provides some pretty good estimates on remaining battery life as well, I think better than the built in monitoring service. 
* Fitbit / Google Fit / Basis / Jawbone / etc - they're good for displaying data collected from other services. I think some of them have food/liquid intake tracking services too; not sure about that though because I don't use that part. 
* IFTT / Tasker - Not strictly lifelogging, but it's good for setting rules or actions based on location or other factors. Like you could set your phone to vibrate when you get to work, or silent when you're going to sleep. This is really more for the manipulation of behavior side of QS, rather than the accumulation of data. 
* JeFit - good weight-lifting/exercise tracking app. It also has a website to view and download workout routines. You can enter measurements about your body and track how the workouts affect your results. It also provides pretty good descriptions and images on how to do the exercises. 
* Calendar - Google's coming out with an update to the calendar app to go with their new 5.0 suite and it looks pretty sweet. I use this to keep track of activities and appointments and what I have to do. It's great because it integrates with Google Now which provides me notifications about when I should leave in order to get to my appointments on time. 
* ToodleDo - great to-do list service. Their android app is a little lackluster, but the amount of detail you can go into for task tracking is incredible. One of the things I really like about it is that when I get near a location where I've said I have things to do, it pops up a notification telling me I've got things to do there. 
* Untappd - this app lets you record and rate beers that you're drinking and then offers you rewards and suggestions based on what you enter. 
* KeepTrack (Pro) - if you want to set up trackers that you have to manually enter, this is the best app for that. There are several generic data types that you can use to create questions/trackers on just about anything you want. If you go with the Pro version, you can group the trackers together and form more complex questions/trackers. For example, among other things, I keep track of my mood with this app; I have a group tracker that includes a predefined list tracker of moods to select, a number tracker to indicate the intensity of the selected mood, and a text notes tracker to describe how I'm feeling in more detail, or to provide context about what I'm doing. The in-app analytics have greatly improved recently, with the ability to aggregate data on the device. There are line charts, pie charts, a calendar view, and some basic statistics about the trackers available. In the line chart, you can include data from multiple trackers for comparison. You can also set up reminders for trackers to get a notification on a specific schedule to prompt you to record data for particular trackers. The backups and export features are also top notch; there's even integration with Google Drive. 

Jawbone Up and Google Fit recently launched with device based tracking (also support their respective wearables)

Lift is also pretty good for tracking behavior, but does require user input.

I think you need the Samsung S5 for it to work but the new Lark app is pretty fun for tracking activity and sleep. A bit gimmicky but good for passive tracking. 

- The Moves app to track location (incl places, so you can answer questions such as how much time did I spend at coffee shops or at home last month).
- Sleep as Android to track sleep. Can't say how accurate it is, but at the very least you can use it to keep a record of when you go to bed, and when you get up.
- Strava to track walks, runs or cycling trips. Maybe submit a feature request for a wheelchair activity option?

Thanks for this very thorough answer!

The article should have mentioned the Angel sensor, built around this very idea of privacy of your data. They're apparently ready to ship a second batch of sensors, but I don't really see these crowdfunded operations ever getting their production lines ready for any type of mass market consumption.

Great to see a review focusing on privacy... The first question you should always ask is ""can I remove my data""; see also the privacy policy reviews at https://forum.quantifiedself.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=20

They actually have an API, but they don't document it in any way. You have to login first and get the session cookie to access it. The problem with that, is that you have to give them your data first, so that you can retrieve it via the API.

Thanks! Wasn't aware there was such a thing :)

Thanks! For me the biggest question is -- what happens to the data that I have on the longer term? As companies rise and fall, and products do the same, I want to have my own data on the longer term. And since they are so focused on owning the data, they don't give me enough means to export it and store it on the long run.

That's what I mean.  Their API is extremely basic as far as I can tell (the public facing aspects of it anyway).  What would be more ideal would be being able to lift the restriction of the data having to go to their servers before anything else.  This is especially important considering from the sounds of things they're dropping support for the B1 to focus on their new Peak.

If they shut out support in software updates for the B1 now, and introduce some bug that makes syncing to their servers problematic, all of a sudden I have a $200 paperweight.  

My theory is that they actually do that on purpose. They have a 2-year old thread on their support forum for an API to pull out the data from their cloud. To pull the data directly from their device? No way. They want to *own* your data, and want to remove any barriers that can prevent them from doing that.

They have enough hurdles as it is -- low market share & general lack of engagement in wearables -- to introduce a new way for data to stop reaching them.

The way I think of it is -- do I derive enough value from using it despite me having to willingly give up my data?

I work with a lot of case managers and social workers in very high stress environments, and I think there is a great model for taking care of yourself and tracking your mental states over time. This has been very helpful to me and could be really helpful to many others. I hope this could provide a layer of information to make improvements and understanding how energy levels and motivation change over time. I want to make this super easy and simple to track with a few minutes each day but get some really substantive and useful metrics with tools and tips to make positive changes. Happy to give free access to any tool that gets developed out of these conversations, I'm really just trying to make sure that its the most useful and effective that it can be.So I am curious..  would you simply just leave it up to the person to rate their fatigue, burnout etc. in a survey style. Or would u focus on some indirect metrics that could correlate or indicate the potential burnout.  

The [VA's PTSD app](http://mobihealthnews.com/10785/va-creates-app-for-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/) might record some metrics that are relevant to burnout?

Yeah - a couple different layers of info, but mostly indirect questions that can indicate potential burnout. Daily questions are quick and more routine based (did you eat lunch at your desk, did you take a short walk), weekly and monthly questions take just a little longer and approach stress and quality of life metrics from several different angles with the questions to get a better holistic look.

Neat. I tracked my happiness for about three years before I figured I had learnt what I needed to and stopped.

[Here is the spreadsheet of my data with pretty charts and graphs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-oQW2PE7kr9Rjk0WThEbVA4Rmc/view?usp=sharing) (It is Google so you will need to download the file to see it properly) (I think, let me know if the link is broken!)

METHODS: I used a retrospective daily recording. I would wake up in the morning, recall my previous day, and write down a series of numbers and letters before getting out of bed: High-Score, Reason for High-Score, Low-Score, Reason for Low-Score, Overall (not an average). The ""Reasons"" were limited to these tags: Meditation, Class (I was in school at the beginning), Social, Alone, Exercise, Drugs (including alcohol/caffeine), Food, Biological (headaches, etc), and Job. I was also able to double-tag (for example, a great lunch with friends could be SF for Social Food, or if the food was better than the company, FS)

Retrospective reports have limitations, but measuring something in the heat of things also has limitations, and random-daytime probes have limitations. Every method has limitations, but the thing to note is that the measurements were pretty consistent (I missed a few days in there, like OP, and should have added an extra tag for belated entries, but the vast majority were done the morning of the following day). This started as a general 1-10 scale, but I expanded it as needed. Rather than saying ""well, I put a 6 here last time so, 6 again!"" I went with what I felt, and I do have the introspection to get a decent read on my emotional state. Of course this is my idiosyncratic arbitrary scale; I would say writing this I am about an 8 happy (I am pretty happy right now) but maybe OP would rate this same feeling as a 6 or 7 and reserve a 10 for something else^1.

RESULTS: See for yourself!

* Date of the month did not matter
* Day of the week did not matter
* Eye-balling the monthly graph reveals an oscillating curve with a period of about 6-months  (seasonal?)
* Low-scores remained relatively constant over the three years
* Overall-scores increased over the three years^2
* High-scores increased over the three years^2
* High-scores were usually social or alone time
* Low-scores were usually alone or social time

I did not know the proper statistical methods for analysing the reasons back when I did this so these come with a pile of salt (but also seemed face-value accurate to me):

* Meditation, Food, and Exercise typically resulted in stable higher scores
* Social-time was usually a stable medium-high score while alone-time was less stable and lower scoring
* Biology was a pretty stable *bad* time (I had a headache-condition)
* Job was also a bad time, but less stable

The most interesting thing I learnt was from late October 2011: I recorded my emotional valence through a particularly rough breakup. Pretty suddenly, a girl I loved deeply broke up with me. This happened to be near the lowering states brought about that oscillating curve. November in particular shows vastly dropped low-scores, and those couple of months show perhaps slightly blunted high- and overall-scores, but it was nice to see that two months was all it took. Two months and the scores are indistinguishable from the pre-breakup scores. It was really nice to put a number on ""my breakup healing time"". 

It was a fun experiment in self-tracking, but I know that when I started I would have to collect at least 6 months of data to see anything at all. The more I collected the more I saw, but then I felt like I reached a point of diminishing returns. It would be neat to track it for a decade, but daily stuff is too cumbersome for me to bother. I am tracking my [personality](http://www.personal.psu.edu/j5j/IPIP/ipipneo300.htm) changes for the long term (7 years in and pretty neat results so far!)

^1  I personally feel like this is a problem with self-report scales, especially when using a finite scale. For example, OP says the scale used is 0-9, but OP never rates anything higher than an 8 or lower than a 4, so it seems to me that OP's scale is really a 4-8 scale, which is only a 5-point scale. If one wishes to capture the nuances of happiness, well, I know *I* needed a bigger scale to get the precision. My lowest score is a -4 and my highest score is a 13 so I covered an 18 point spread. Ultimately inter-scale comparisons are impossible. I could appear happier and more emotionally unstable than OP, but the opposite could be just as true since we are not using the same scale.

^2 This increase in overall- and high-scores could be due to some kind of score-creep in reporting bias. The fact that my low-scores remained constant brings this explanation into question, however. Also, subjectively I did feel that I got happier over those three years so it seems very in-line with what I recall about that time in my life.

This is pretty insightful, I liked the discussion on sampling time where he begins to doubt if tracking happiness over a long period of time actually makes sense. Some comment stated that a shorter time (month?) allows for quicker reaction and improvement. 

This is a great post. Have you thought of talking about it at a Quantified Self meetup?

> High-scores were usually social or alone time, low-scores were usually alone or social time

I'm tempted to ask ""what else is there?"" but I see you have other categories (meditation, class, exercise) and so some experiences are neither ""social"" nor ""alone"".

> Two months and the scores are indistinguishable from the pre-breakup scores.

I think ""I stopped feeling bad and got back to normal"" is probably the right interpretation, but how can you tell the difference between this and ""I acclimated to my new range""?  I mean, it's not plausible that a breakup would make you less happy for the rest of your life, but maybe it took longer to actually recover?  Or less long, if there was some bias in the form of expecting to write down things more similar to what you'd been writing down lately.

> For example, OP says the scale used is 0-9, but OP never rates anything higher than an 8 or lower than a 4, so it seems to me that OP's scale is really a 4-8 scale, which is only a 5-point scale.

The problem is I can easily imagine feeling more or less happy than 4/8.  I expect those states to happen to me at times, so I want to have a wide enough range that I can capture them. I'm also not confident I could distinguish between smaller gradations than I'm using; 5-6-7 aren't actually very far apart in terms of internal experience, I'm a pretty stable person.

> some experiences are neither ""social"" nor ""alone""

Yeah, it was more about the source of the emotion. I could be exercising alone and the aloneness has nothing to do with it, or I could be done exercising and showering and feel fantastic because of the exercise: in either case exercise is the reason. Alternatively, I could be home alone feeling terrible because of a negative social experience so social would be the reason even though I was alone.

>how can you tell the difference between this and ""I acclimated to my new range""

I guess because I lived it. If I understand you correctly, that would mean I got used to feeling bad and ""bad"" became my new normal. But then I would just feel bad so I would expect to see a drop in scores that became a stable drop. On the other hand, the scores go back to normal and that is in line with my experience of eventually getting over the relationship and moving on with my life.

> if there was some bias in the form of expecting to write down things more similar to what you'd been writing down lately.

I do not really understand this. Why would I *a priori* expect the number to be similar day to day? It seems to me that I just wrote down whatever struck me in the moment as the correct number. The numbers change too so even *post hoc* it does not seem that there is a bias in trying to write similar numbers. I am probably just not clear on this idea of yours.

>The problem is I can easily imagine feeling more or less happy than 4/8

In my view, that imagination is useless on your scale if you never use those numbers. Perhaps you had a very stable year, but it is also plausible that you had a sort of artificial ceiling/floor effect. I think the range of emotions available to a human are too vast to capture on such a small scale. It is like looking at the world population in terms of percentages; there are 7 billion people so ten-thousand deaths is a 0% drop in population.

To elaborate, I think if the emotional range was actually limited to 1-10 then all my scores would have been 5. The depths of pain possible are immense much as the heights of ecstasy are towering. The breakup was shitty, but I could imagine being drawn and quartered after being tortured for three weeks, having my finger-nails and teeth pulled out one by one and 2/3 of the skin on my body flayed off; with a finite scale, that experience would probably be a 1 or a 2 out of 10 since I can imagine worse. If that is near the bottom of the scale, my breakup was a 5. On the other hand, I could imagine mystical self-transcending feelings of unity, peace, and love, and remaining in that state all afternoon, which I guess would be about a 9 out of 10, because there is probably better. If that is near the top of the scale, the most caring and tender moment with friends while eating the most fantastic meal is a 5, *maybe* a 6.

>I'm also not confident I could distinguish between smaller gradations than I'm using

Perhaps you would find more interesting results if you adopted a retrospective approach. Like you said, your phone does not probe you when you are at your lowest point of tending to a sobbing baby at 3am. If you just get probes during the day when you are engaged in mundane tasks it makes sense that you would have moderate numbers and stability. You are unlikely to get a probe just at the height of orgasm or just after you stub your toe, but if these were the highlight and lowlight of your day, you could remember them, as well as a gist/overall for the rest of the day. Also, I do meditate and apparently [meditation experience predicts introspective accuracy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23049790).

> I could be exercising alone and the aloneness has nothing to do with it, or I could be done exercising and showering and feel fantastic because of the exercise

Makes sense.  I guess there's some potential for thinking you feel good because you've been exercising but actually it was the time spent outside or something, but ""why do I think I feel good"" is probably good enough to optimize on.

> If I understand you correctly, that would mean I got used to feeling bad and ""bad"" became my new normal.

Right.  Imagine you lost most of your energy permanently, through something like chronic lyme disease.  At first this would really suck, because each day feels like a regular day that you start exhausted.  But then over time you get used to the new state and start reporting higher numbers.  (Which is what we expect: most research on this finds that people have a ""happiness set point"" and after any sort of event they tend to drift back to reporting a similar level of happiness they reported before.)  There are two reasons you might now be reporting higher levels of happiness: (1) you actually do feel almost as good as you did before you got lyme or (2) you've gotten used to the situation and it doesn't actively make you sad anymore.  Ideally you could experience days in alternation, one day with lyme and one without, and then you could make a good comparison, but the longer you've been living with lyme the more remote your higher-energy days become and the harder it is to compare your current state to your pre-lyme state.

> Why would I a priori expect the number to be similar day to day? It seems to me that I just wrote down whatever struck me in the moment as the correct number. The numbers change too so even post hoc it does not seem that there is a bias in trying to write similar numbers.

People often have vaguely mood-like things that last many days.  For example you found oscillations at the 6-month level, sometimes I have a few weeks when I feel generally uninspired and bored, etc.  When you've been feeling up/down lately the numbers you will be recording will as a whole be on the high/low side.  If someone asked you ""predict how you will be feeling tomorrow"" you would predict high/low based on how you'd been feeling lately.  So then when it comes time to ask yourself ""how am I feeling now"" you're going to be biased by the answer you would have expected yourself to give.  For example, when I'm at work I generally am reasonably content but not super happy and usually put ""6"".  But then if I'm unusually enjoying my work and get pinged I feel like ""this is a situation in which I would usually put '6', because I'm working"" and have to override that, really introspect, see how I'm feeling, and then put down, say, ""7"".  And I might fail to do that, or just be pulled down towards my expectation so that I round the other direction from where I would if I didn't have the ""I know I'm at work and when I'm here I tend to put '6'"" bias.

> Perhaps you had a very stable year

So, first off, I'm a very stable person.  I tend not to get very happy or sad and I tend to generally feel on the happy side.

>  I think if the emotional range was actually limited to 1-10 then all my scores would have been 5. The depths of pain possible are immense much as the heights of ecstasy are towering.

My scale isn't linear.  I want to have the most range available in the parts I'm likely to use.  So the difference between 5 and 6 is small, while 6 to 7 is larger, 7 to 8 is even larger, and 8 to 9 is really extremely large.  I do have some moments outside of the 4-8 range, but they're so brief that I'm really not likely to get pinged during one of them.  Even 8 basically only happens when I get pinged at the top of some experience that is normally very good but in this circumstance is extremely good.  (Spending time with friends I rarely see, and right after someone says something especially funny and I'm just starting  to laugh I get pinged.)

> You are unlikely to get a probe just at the height of orgasm or just after you stub your toe, but if these were the highlight and lowlight of your day, you could remember them, as well as a gist/overall for the rest of the day.

These I already capture through the normal human means of ""remembering important things"".  What I want experience sampling for is to get access to a view of the past that doesn't weight extreme experiences more highly.  Your remembered past, either generally or as written highlights and lowlights, is like a movie: full of the important stuff but skipping over all the mundane details.  And to a large extent that's what I care about.  But I also want to be able to see how much of my life was spent waiting for the bus.

> Makes sense. I guess there's some potential for thinking you feel good because you've been exercising but actually it was the time spent outside or something, but ""why do I think I feel good"" is probably good enough to optimize on.

As I said, any self-report methodology has this problem. This is strictly unavoidable. Even if we were to use an objective bio-marker for happiness, we would first need to develop objective bio-markers by correlating them to self-report, and we are back to square-one.

> Right. Imagine you lost most of your energy permanently, through something like chronic lyme disease...

I actually had a chronic pain problem called ""New Daily Persistent Headache"" that lasted about three years. I had a headache 100% of the time I was awake (and sometimes in my dreams). I can confidently say that I did not ""get used to it"". Sure, people tend to have a ""happiness set point"", and I was happy during much of the time when I had headaches, but I was also in pain and was not as happy as I would have been had I been pain-free, and introspection revealed this to me trivially. Though I did start to forget what it was like to *not* have headaches, I never forgot that it was vastly superior to having a headache. All I can say is that my experience does not align with your proposed explanation.

>>Why would I a priori expect the number to be similar day to day?

>...If someone asked you ""predict how you will be feeling tomorrow"" you would predict high/low based on how you'd been feeling lately. So then when it comes time to ask yourself ""how am I feeling now"" you're going to be biased by the answer you would have expected yourself to give.

Nope, I am going to introspect in that moment and come up with a number based on how I am feeling. Why would I give a number for now that is based on a number I predicted in the past? That seems extremely counter-intuitive to me since *now* is available to me *right now* and all I need do is introspect.

Consider the weather: *If someone asked you ""predict the weather tomorrow"" you would predict high/low based on how the weather has been lately. So then when it comes time to ask yourself ""how is the weather now"" you're going to be biased by the answer you would have expected yourself to give.* Nonsense! You are going to look outside or read a thermometer. If you predicted rain and it is sunny, you are not going to be biased by your prediction, you are going to report sunny skies.

>For example, when I'm at work I generally am reasonably content but not super happy and usually put ""6"". But then if I'm unusually enjoying my work and get pinged I feel like ""this is a situation in which I would usually put '6', because I'm working"" and have to override that, really introspect, see how I'm feeling, and then put down, say, ""7"".

That is totally counter-intuitive to me. I just - *whomph* - introspect on a moment's notice. I guess I am just a more accurate introspector than you? Like I linked, meditation can apparently do that.

> So, first off, I'm a very stable person. I tend not to get very happy or sad and I tend to generally feel on the happy side.

Yup, me too. (Breakup is an obvious exception but generally I am very stable, calm, and content, and even moreso now than at the time of collecting this data)

> My scale isn't linear ... the difference between 5 and 6 is small, while 6 to 7 is larger, 7 to 8 is even larger, and 8 to 9 is really extremely large. ... 8 basically only happens when I get pinged at the top of some experience that is normally very good but in this circumstance is extremely good.

What can you learn from your data when all you get back is a whole bunch of 6s? This is a double-trouble for you since even if you are actually having a 7 in a regularly 6 situation, your personal bias is to go based on what you thought you would feel (a 6) rather than introspect on what you actually feel in that moment (a 7). It sounds to me like you are extremely limiting your range, additionally so since it is non-linear in a vague way.

My question for you becomes 'why do you want it to be easier to write a 6'? You are consciously biasing your scale toward being a 6. I think this makes your data a lot less useful. For example, what if you wanted to see a movie and were checking out some reviews, but every movie you saw was a 6/10? This information is almost useless for making a decision.

> These I already capture through the normal human means of ""remembering important things"". What I want experience sampling for is **to get access to a view of the past that doesn't weight extreme experiences more highly**. Your remembered past, either generally or as written highlights and lowlights, is like a movie: full of the important stuff but skipping over all the mundane details. And to a large extent that's what I care about. But I also want to be able to see how much of my life was spent waiting for the bus.

Oh... okay... I guess if you are trying to sample mundane moments and you are biased toward reporting mundane scores it makes sense that you are going to get mundane data...

I do not mean to be a bummer, but I think I totally do not understand what you were trying to quantify. My big question for you would be: What good is your data to you now that you can see it clearly? What can you learn about yourself from your data? Can the data you collected answer the questions you had when you set out? What were those questions? Now that you have been going for a year, are you sure you are using the right methods to answer those questions?

> introspection revealed this to me trivially ... all I need do is introspect ... I just - whomph - introspect on a moment's notice.

It sounds like we have very different experiences with introspection. Maybe it's the meditation helping you, maybe it's just something I'm kind of bad at.  If I try to think about how I'm feeling it usually goes like ""Hmm, I guess I feel fine?  Pretty good, this is nice, I don't know?""

>  It sounds to me like you are extremely limiting your range, additionally so since it is non-linear in a vague way. ... why do you want it to be easier to write a 6

The non-linear scale expands my range dramatically!  Imagine I had a linear scale from 1-10.  I could be both way less and way more happy than I am now, which means I would probably put down ""5"" all the time.  I'm not sure I have ever had moments in my life I would rate above or below ""5"" on a linear 1-10 scale.  So to let there be finer distinctions in the part of my range I spend the most time in, I need a non-linear scale.  Another way to do this would be to have a 1-10000 scale, and use numbers like 500, 2000, 4000, 4998, 4999, 5001, 5002, 6000, 8000, 9500, but that seems awkward.

>Imagine I had a linear scale from 1-10. I could be both way less and way more happy than I am now, which means I would probably put down ""5"" all the time.

It has been a while, but it sounds like you are repeating my criticism back to me:

>>To elaborate, I think if the emotional range was actually limited to 1-10 then all my scores would have been 5. The depths of pain possible are immense much as the heights of ecstasy are towering. The breakup was shitty, but I could imagine being drawn and quartered after being tortured for three weeks, having my finger-nails and teeth pulled out one by one and 2/3 of the skin on my body flayed off; with a finite scale, that experience would probably be a 1 or a 2 out of 10 since I can imagine worse. If that is near the bottom of the scale, my breakup was a 5. On the other hand, I could imagine mystical self-transcending feelings of unity, peace, and love, and remaining in that state all afternoon, which I guess would be about a 9 out of 10, because there is probably better. If that is near the top of the scale, the most caring and tender moment with friends while eating the most fantastic meal is a 5, maybe a 6.

Like I said, using a finite 1-10 scale is a terrible idea.

> Another way to do this would be to have a 1-10000 scale, and use numbers like 500, 2000, 4000, 4998, 4999, 5001, 5002, 6000, 8000, 9500, but that seems awkward.

On a scale of 1-10,000 you are unlikely to experience 9500. Instead, how about only using a subset of the whole possible emotional scale because you will only experience a subset of possible emotional states. As your numbers show, you are more likely to experience around the 4000-6000 range, so rather than a 1-10,000 scale you could use a 4000-6000 scale and re-normalize that to be a 0-2000 scale or a (-1000) to (+1000) scale. You do not need such precision, though, especially since you do not have introspective access to such precision in the first place, so you cut it by a factor of 100 and you get a 0-20 scale. You re-normalize that to be a (-5) to (+15) scale, and this is my *de facto* scale. You start using numbers in the 1-10 range and expand as needed, but most of the numbers remain in the 1-10 space, yet you still get interesting variance between scores because you have the precision you need to measure the values of interest.

Think of it like ""visible light"" on the electromagnetic spectrum. Your eyes are not sensitive to radio waves or gamma rays, they are sensitive to a narrow band we call visible light. Sure, saying ""visible light"" cuts out a lot of the spectrum, but that is a lot of the spectrum your eyes were not going to detect anyway.

Maybe I am a [highly sensitive person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_sensitive_person). Maybe it is the meditation (as research suggests). If you want to get more introspective prowess, you could try meditation. If you do not care to get more introspective prowess, so be it.

I wonder if that would be sensitive enough? I've had nasty post-nasal drip in the past myself from a cold or something, and I don't remember my eyes always being noticeably red. If you tried to measure redness with a camera wouldn't any changes in redness be overwhelmed by variations in lighting? Or has this already been done?

There is a small color reference chart that has to be included in each snapshot to help deal with variations in lighting.

I'd expect the eyes to get more red from allergies than from a cold, but symptoms will of course differ from person to person (and pollen to pollen)...

This comment probably something for the future rather than an immediate concern because the technology is cost prohibitive.

A monitor of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs - some intercalate DNA, but caffeine/beer appear to protect and abrogate DNA damage) would probably be a useful thing to measure for people who select housing in places where air quality could be poor from wild fires, industry or motorways if that's the sort of ventilation available.  

The equipment to measure PAHs in air is likely to be a great deal more expensive than co2 monitors.  Last I checked, the government environmental agency responsible for measuring atomospheric PAH levels in my area (Sydney) only does it once a year every or so and only within the last decode or so.

The practical option: forget these details, don't live next to a motorway in a city/region with extremely high air pollution in general.  Agriculture in high PAH areas from pollution or fire ravaged soil is also worth avoiding for the appreciable PAH bioaccumulation in plants (milk too?).

> I briefly looked but saw the same disappointing prices then decided not to bother with anything but making sure I had ventilation. 

Yeah, I'm not thrilled with the selection. I have pretty good ventilation as it is now, but when winter comes I'll have to seal up tighter, and that doesn't resolve my questions about the optimum temperature and humidity for sleep. At least temperature/humidity loggers are pretty cheap. I have one now: can't let the perfect air quality monitor be the enemy of better.

> The equipment to measure PAHs in air is likely to be a great deal more expensive than co2 monitors. Last I checked, the government environmental agency responsible for measuring atomospheric PAH levels in my area (Sydney) only does it once a year every or so and only within the last decode or so.

I didn't see PAH mention anywhere at all in any of my searches, so I'm guessing the measurement methods look like 'take a giant filter and ship it off to a lab for a custom analysis'. So, completely infeasible for QSers.

Their are two distinct use cases here: 

  1. Figuring out if there are any problematic substances (e.g. formaldehyde) in the building or in the environment. This can be done with one-off testing kits, or by a professional.

  2. Figuring out if a room is ventilated well enough. There could be trade-offs with noise and temperature. This requires ongoing monitoring (e.g. of the CO2 concentration).

I think my reply was more of a in-between case (and lamentation of ability to measure greater parameters cheaply), as the air requiring monitoring is the ventilated air, which can change in quality by seasonal or other variable external influences, like infrastructure changes in roads, industrial plants, construction, natural disaster, etc.   

A one off professional measurement would not generalise to the fluctuations and there's no cheap solution to measure all parameters affecting health.

Has anyone had experience with the $100-200 EEG headsets?  Thinking about getting one for meditation and drugs but just wondering if they actually produce any interesting and more importantly, accurate date or whether they are just a novelty?

This is the direction that I ended up going.  I'm not even a very good programmer but I ended up making a single program to track everything I needed that linked to my own Postgres server.  It's a bit messy but if I ever want to add anything to it, a new variable or topic to track I can just add it in.

Isn't that expensive for your battery? If you're using Android, google location services is fairly accurately without draining the battery much faster. 

Same here, except I wrapped it up in a REST based web front end.

a) I use cyanogenmod, no google services  
b) not really, I was quite surprised. I still get a full day out of my phone.

What exactly are you tracking? In certain circumstances, I find it acceptable to trade my data for the ease of managing and analyzing it (software engineer here).

What is utterly irritating is the providers tend to not let you export data to other systems because they want to own it. Is there a list of QS apps that don't use the cloud/remote machines?

Keep in mind that Amy Webb has several different versions of her talk that contradict each other. For example, sometimes she claims the bad date at the expensive restaurant wanted to split the bill and other times she claims he sneaked out when the bill arrived. Take anything she has to say as entertainment rather than actual experimental data.

I've been helping a friend by commandeering his tinder account.  Although fairly unscientific, after rapidly going though matches we send the same base message ""Do you like icecream?"" We immediately follow up with ""Well, put your number here _____ and let's go get some [icecream or an alternative depending on their response].  This works very consistently.

This eliminates the improvisation over messages giving a consistent baseline response rate.  From here we can then start split testing.  It also keeps him from investing a large amount of any one match, potentially blowing his chances over instant message.

From there it is a numbers game.  W likes gets X matches.  Send Y messages, and get Z dates.  Getting a date then becomes a matter of sending a certain number of likes/messages.

It would not be as accurate and might not be a great idea if you are on blood thinners (unless you are already doing needle sticks for some other reason) but it might work fine as a relative measure for personal use

Interesting, and yeah I want it to be a relative measurement to see if a change in diet actually helps with the coagulation factor of blood. My wife has a type of blood factor that makes her blood clot more thus leading to possible issues later in life, so we were going to try to increase intake of foods that are ""suppose"" to thin the blood e.g garlic and ginger.

So knowing whether or not there is a change, even if its not the most accurate would be good.

Thanks for the advice :)

Is that kind of the whole basis for it?
> 
> [William J. Walsh]:	That is a lot of it. For things like depression and anxiety and behavior disorders, that is pretty much what is important. But there are other disorders like autism that actually are developmental disorders and in that case brain develops differently and you have what they call connectivity problems where different parts of the brain are slightly off spacially or you might even say geographically. They do not connect like they should. It depends on the disorder but in most mental disorders, it is the chemistry that tends to dominate unless of course if the person has had a head injury or a stroke or something like that. I would say 95% of the cases, it is biochemistry.

> ...A big surprise for me was that in the areas of depression and behavior disorders and ADD and even schizophrenia that about 95% of them seemed to have those conditions because of their abnormal biochemistry and by correcting and normalizing these brain chemicals, we were able to help most of them based on outcome studies.

> ...But what we found, I think the world’s biggest chemistry database for depression and what we found quite clearly is that depression is a world used for at least five completely different conditions. About nearly half of them have something else wrong and they are not going to get better. Antidepressants are not going to help the rest of them. For example, one of these involves a condition that females have that involves elevated copper levels which has to do with hormone abnormalities and these people have severe anxiety and depression and antidepressants don’t help them. The drugs don’t help them. Within about 60 to 90 days, we can usually completely correct that condition and most of them tell us that the depression is gone and they can throw away their medications.

However, what we have learned is that with respect to brain function, the function of the brain that might go wrong, there is only about six or eight nutrient factors that have a really dominant effect. And if we focus on those six or eight factors, we are able to help nearly everyone and the beauty of that is we do not have to do lab work for 300 different nutrients and we do not have to get a treatment to try to normalize 300 or dozens and dozens of things. If we can normalize these six or eight dominant nutrient factors, we can help most people.

> ...Let me just give you one example. Abram Hoffer in the ‘50s. 60 years ago, he was the first person to demonstrate hat nutrients can have a dramatic impact on a person’s mental health. He found that giving niacin to schizophrenics had a dramatic improvement on so many of them...Now we know that because of epigenetics, that niacin dramatically reduces dopamine activity. So for the first time we understand why Hoffer’s niacin treatments work and that is wonderful to understand. So now we know because of this new epigenetic field, we understand what methyl does, what SAMe or methionine do and because of epigenetics, they are reuptake inhibitors that increase serotonin activity which is exactly what you want.
> 
> ...[William J. Walsh]:	That is a very good question. The ranges that you see from laboratories whether it is Quest or LabCorp or Sonic or something like that, these are basically what they call two-sigma ranges. There are ranges in which roughly 95% of the population sits between these two levels. And they are extraordinarily broad. But the functional ranges for mental health are much narrower. For example, whole blood histamine, the range is typically are between 25 and 150. However, Carl Pfeifer found years ago for mental health, the range should be between 40 and 70. And people who are below 40 are basically over methylated and people who are over 70 are undermethylated. These broad ranges that you see on the lab reports, sometimes you have to ignore those ranges and focus on the narrow ranges that are related to mental functioning not just general physical health.
> 
> ..[Damien Blenkinsopp]:	It is really amazing what you are doing. I want to look a little bit toward the future use of this over the next ten years. Could you see this kind of natural biochemical therapies replacing some of the drugs that are used with mental disorders today? How do you see this evolving over the next ten years for example where you would hope to see it evolve?
> 
> [William J. Walsh]:	What I think is happening is I think we are just in the beginning stages of a new era in mental health. For about 100 years, we had the psychiatry model which lasted up until 1965 where the thought was if a person had depression or a mental problem, it was because of their life experiences. Then in 1965 which was the biochemical revolution in psychiatry, they began to realize that the problem really was neurotransmitters and brain chemistry and mental functions, chemical imbalances in the brain. The only way at that time, they knew how to correct and help these people was with drugs. So we have been on a pharmaceutical era that started in 1965 and I believe it is about to end.
> 
> ...We are not enclosed to drugs. I want to make that plaint. Drugs, antidepressants, antipsychotics, so I have helped millions of people but I think that in most cases, improvements are partial in nature and the side effects very often are intolerable or very unpleasant and I think we need to move toward a better world, a better time when we can at least reduce the amount of the drugs. In schizophrenics, most of them are on very heavy antipsychotic medication. Right now our knowledge level is not to the point where we can offer the likelihood to do nutrient therapy of eliminating their medications. So what we do is we keep people on their medication, do our nutrient therapy together, do both at the same time. After about three or four months after we have completed our part of it, we then test lower and lower levels of the medication. For depression, for anxiety, for behavior disorders, about 80% of the people tell us that they are at their best with zero medication. 20% say they would lose something if they get rid of the last piece of the medication and we say so be it. We are not opposed to medication. We just want people to be functioning at their highest level. In schizophrenia, it is unusual. We can usually have schizophrenics become far more functional and many of them live a normal life, they can return to a normal life and be self dependent.
> 
> ...I am undermethylated, the way I corrected that, I used to be with methionine but now I take 400 milligrams of SAMe a day and for me that works really well and what it does for me, it does two things. I used to have migraine headaches and they have disappeared ever since I’ve take some methylation. And I also had really severe seasonal allergies, ragweed, grasses, I don’t want allergies. That has also disappeared as soon as I went on Pfeiffer’s program.
>

Take a look at the quotes. If '95%' of autism cases are 'biochemistry' just like he's been talking about in the cases of depression/schizophrenia/ADD, then it stands to reason he also thinks autism is diagnosable with a blood test.

Problem I have VERY little HTML knowledge and even less CSS and Java and no knowledge of JSON and working with APIs.  I understand this is an undertaking but I'm looking for a starting spot.  I don't want to waste too much time in learning non-essential programming language and processes but reading the API docs over at fitbit and trakt.tv I don't even know where to start building the base knowledge to even submit and process the response for OAuth requests.  Help!What are your goals for the dashboard? and what API's do you want to tap into?

The first thing I would recommend is settling on your back-end.  There are a few decent, lightweight frameworks that I would recommend: [Express](http://expressjs.com/) with Node.js or [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) with Ruby. These can help you get up and going pretty quickly.

For Node, [tonic](https://github.com/tmrudick/tonic) may prove helpful to you. It is a library specifically made to hit external APIs regularly. Here is a [site built with it](https://github.com/tmrudick/tomrudick.com).

For Ruby/Sinatra, [this](https://github.com/camdub/fit) is a good example.

Here are some sites for inspiration:

- [April Zero](http://aprilzero.com/)
- [api.hopkins.io](http://api.hopkins.io/)
- [Tom Rudick](http://tomrudick.com/)

It is quite a large undertaking if you're going from ground zero. I have only dabbled without coming up with something finished. Good luck!

Also curious about what your goals are; I assume you looked at some of the existing services in this space (like [ours](https://zenobase.com/), or [one of the other services listed here](https://zenobase.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/360890-how-does-zenobase-compare-to-other-services))?

If you know ruby, there is [Dashing](http://dashing.io/). It is based on Sinatra and focuses on dashboards.

goal is to incorporate the following services:

* Rescue Time
* Gmail usage
* Adwards
* Google analytics
* LinkedIn
* MailChimp
* MyFitnessPal

It isn't that hard for an experienced developer but if you have zero knowledge with Java I really wouldn't recommend it. If you do decide to build it I can highly recommend Python+ Django and Foundation CSS as a web front end. That combination will save you so much trouble :)

If you want to get fancy take a look at elasticsearch. It will allow you to do lots of intresting things with you data, really, really quick.

I could build it in less than a week depending on how challenging the API's are, a more experienced developer in two days.

Hopefully there are enough early adopters with deep pockets that can drive the price down for the rest of us.

Hemavu's pricing seems competitive with services like [WellnessFX](http://www.wellnessfx.com/) and [InsideTracker](https://www.insidetracker.com/)--and a lot cheaper than having a doctor order tests that the insurance won't cover.

The cost is still too high for doing experiments that require frequent testing, e.g. how much do vitamin D levels vary from day to day, or how does running a marathon affects the body). The [Cue](https://cue.me/) ($10 per test) could a promising solution for this niche market.

This kind of testing is something I'd like to eventually do on a regular basis, not just as part of an experiment but as part of a long-term health management regiment. At that level of testing, even $10 per test is too much (daily use, that's $3650 per year). What I'd really like to see is tech like this that has re-usable testing cartridges, with software that works based on a monthly/yearly subscription model.

Frequent tests can make sense if you are dealing with a health issue, comparing the effectiveness of different interventions, or doing something crazy like running an ultramarathon.

Not sure frequent tests would be much of a benefit for long-term health management.

I thinking of setting myself up as a Quantified coach. The idea being I would take on client, then set out specific goals. I was thinking of things like:

* increase productivity
* improve sleep
* improve mood
* lose weight

It pretty much could be anything. But then I would set up integrated tracking for that person, I would rent them the appropriate tech. And integrate it into the cloud so I could personally track.  

Would this be a service that you imagine their might be a good demand for? What would you like to get from a service like this? I have a couple of developers working for me and I already have a pretty good system which captures the data for myself. 


Why would a person do this rather than buy the tech themselves?

Coaches have been using fitness trackers to increase motivation and ""adherence"" in coach potatoes, and to prevent overtraining in athletes for a while now. In fact it's not uncommon for products and services in this space to be marketed not just to consumers but also to coaches (see e.g. [BodyMedia](http://www.bodymedia.com/Professionals/Fitness-Professionals) or [Tictrac](https://www.tictrac.com/business)).

That said, it's quite possible that there is a lot of unmet demand. The [Quantified Doctor](http://quantdoctor.com/) had enough demand at one point that he was looking for other professionals to refer patients to, but I don't have much insight into the health and ""life"" coaching market.

One issue some people might have with such a coaching service is that they'd want some control over what data is shared with the coach, and when it is shared.

In any case, would love to hear more about how you collect and analyze your own data!


The value add in my mind was: 

* Leverage: Having someone you are answerable to increase the chances you will stick to it. Being able to send text congratulating or motivating. 
* Being lent the equipment: Some of the most expensive equipment you could be lent rather than purchase. Test like humidity, so on, you might only need it for the period tests. 
* Knowledge: Having a good idea of what to test and how some people may not know where to start. Someone who has already gone their and worked helping other people would have a better idea. 
* Some of it's complicated: Connecting up a lot of the tracking gets a bit complicated. I've develop tools to track things like productivity and focus and compile it in one place. Things like figuring out food sensitivities is tricky. 

All this could be done yourself, the idea is just to add value as a specialist. 

Thanks zenobase, I'm looking through this stuff now. I can't seem to find a  API for the Tictrac, which seems weird. 

I'm tracking a lot, I'll probable do some longer posts on it. But My main concern come with productivity at the moment and trying to track that against other things. I'm playing with a rescue time and comparing that how I use my email box and pompadour technique. I'll do a more in-depth post when I have something solid.  

Here's my thoughts

With the equipment issue unless you are getting into a tier that is medical professional level equipment the QS stuff that is targeted towards consumers is not at unreasonable price points and is evolving fast so you would have a hard time keeping your inventory up to date.

I think a lot of the QS stuff is about putting the power into the individuals hands through data. Unless the person had a medical degree allowing more sophisticated interpretation of the information and can't see myself wanting someone else involved.  

FYI Tictrac is only B2B now and unsupported.

Thanks secretcrazy. I'll mull it over, maybe it would be more of a plug on to standard coaching. 

What if a PA helped here? Or an RN? Pharmacist? Just curious what you think would help to get people to pay, if at all.

I'm not sure what a PA or a RN are in this context (I'm from the UK).  If their is a value add here where we can prove I could help people over doing it themselves then I'm sure their is a business. Just not sure if it's a enough value. To justify being worth the time. 

An RN/NP is a nurse. A PA is a physician's assistant. Both are midlevel providers. An RN is the cheapest, probably your best bet. Would you hired a quantified coach? What would appeal to you.

We [support Automatic](http://blog.zenobase.com/post/85051519482). Planning to do a screencast looking at how factors like weather or sleep affect gas mileage, but don't have enough data yet.

Some caveats: Collecting data via their Android app has been unreliable (but appears to be getting better). Also, Automatic's API does not include the driving score, and the driving score is designed to reward fuel-efficient, not safe driving (sometimes the two conflict).

Dash also looks promising, but the API isn't ready yet.

This is great! I plan to automate data collection as well, so this is super helpful. In your blog post, you mention that you tried Torque Pro. This seems to be the most popular and comprehensive app available. Do you know if it has background service capabilities? I will probably pass up TouchScan since I definitely want reliable data logging - which app do you plan to switch over to?

Thanks and great site! Any reason in particular for choosing Automatic? Torque seems to provide more comprehensive data but I'm guessing it doesn't have an API. I'll keep my eye out for your screencast.

As a side note, I saw your post about the Reporter app. I believe this is iOS only. Do you happen to know of a comparable Android app for custom question prompts?

Yes, chose Automatic because they have a Web API. If other apps can export to a CSV file, that data could be imported via a custom script (glad to help with that), see e.g. http://blog.zenobase.com/post/84362516897.

There's a bunch of Android apps that let you record custom data; if what you're interested in is Reporter's random sampling, see e.g. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pacoapp.paco&hl=en.

Currently (I'm calling it mento) is purely in the cloud with offline support. 

Building an API that would allow you to pull back all your ticks would be fairly easy. However I'm still debating if I'd want to go market with the cloud database or have it be purely local with Dropbox syncing to reduce infrastructure costs. 

Let me know when that is!

Awesome!! thanks!!!

Having either a Web API (like e.g. the Sleep as Android app) or Dropbox syncing (like the Reporter app) would be useful. But I'm also thinking about providing a ""sync adapter"" that would make it trivial for apps like yours to let their users send data to a service like ours.

Have you tried google location tracking? It will be in the location settings of your android phone (don't know about iOS support, sorry).

Then, head to maps.google.com/locationhistory

The battery damage is minimal, and its fairly accurate. You can also export the data as KML files.

This is hard because generally you need to do three things to continuously track location (at least on iOS):

1.  You need to run your app constantly in the background.
2.  You need to monitor certain sensors to figure out when someone is moving.  At least the accelerometer, and maybe the gyroscope and compass.  The M7 ties into these sensors on the 5S.
3.  You need to turn on the GPS when the person is moving.

All of these, and especially point three, result in high battery drain.  Region monitoring and other things that apple has introduced just aren't reliable enough to continuously track location.

iOS 8 is trying to improve this with visit monitoring (http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/04/apple-improves-location-services-in-ios-8-with-when-in-use-mode-visit-monitoring/), which may make this kind of app much better on battery life.  But turning on the GPS (which you need for <100 meter accuracy) will always result in high battery drain.  Of course, if you only care about when you stop, and not your route, etc, you can get away with only using the GPS sparingly.

That said, moves has been pretty good for me.  What kind of battery drain per hour are you seeing from it when still vs when moving?

Saga's interface is WAY too crowded to be useful, and I can't think of a reason why it would have better battery performance than Moves.

Not trying to offend but Saga really needs to be streamlined. I tried it out because it works with IFTTT but even that perk wasn't enough to get me to switch.

mind=blown

Wow...I have Moves but had no idea that my location history was being backed up.  This is incredible.  Thanks!



My phone rarely makes it though the day, and it's always a stressor for me. Moves is the only high-battery drain app that I use (according to BatteryDoctor for Android).

I haven't measured benchmarks for myself though.

I used Moves for a bit and have switched to saga. I agree that the user interface could use some improvements, but the differences in battery life were noticeable enough for me to stick with saga.

Saga appears to be a bit smarter and doesn't poll the GPS quite as often as Moves does. I'm sure ZelgadisA027123 can elaborate...

Both apps make frequent wrong guesses, so reviewing the data regularly is a good idea.

One big plus for Moves is the public API, which lets you use your data with third party services; still waiting to get access to Saga's API...

Don't know about the long term future of either Moves (acquired) or Saga (transferred to parent company).

Honestly, I don't ever actually open Saga except once a week or when I restart my phone to make sure it keeps running... So to me, the UI is irrelevant. Haven't noticed much of a battery drain compared to Moves or anything else - been using it for a while (6 mos? A year?) with no major issues. 

Honestly, for this category of app, battery is going to be an issue no matter what app you choose for the reasons outlined elsewhere in the thread. Location ain't cheap. 

Yeah, it's incredible from a QS perspective. Some might see it as a bit creepy though - Google turns it on by default.

Is the driving simulation game a good measure of alertness?Ideally, you would sample the same people at multiple times during the day, and across people at the same times. e.g., you could measure RTs for 30 people at 3hr intervals starting at 8am. But if your goal is to determine which times of the day people are generally most alert, then you would also want to measure the same people on multiple days, to rule out confounds associated with the day (e.g., people might be more alert at night-time on weekends because they get more sleep, or less alert at night-time on Mondays because they get less sleep).

[You could use this one instead](http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/). It is much faster. The one you linked has different sized stimuli and the road is stationary while there are white lines that move. It is an odd stimulus, but it makes sense for the website trying to show the dangers of sleep deprivation on driving.

The main confound is that you would be testing reaction time, not ""alertness"" per se. You would get good data on the changes in reaction time throughout the day, but whether your results generalize depend on how you define ""alertness"".

For example, ""alertness"" could be inferred from testing verbal comprehension of a passage of text, a test that does not require reaction time. On the other hand, a verbal comprehension test taps into measuring mind-wandering so this would be confounded. It all comes down to your definition of ""alertness"", but this reaction time test is a good start.

[Muse](http://www.choosemuse.com/) and [Melon](http://www.thinkmelon.com/) should have that data soon...

Indeed, based on a fairly large sample of games played on my part, not only is it not clear that reaction time would predict performance in other measures of alertness, but it is unclear if reaction time measures alertness adequately for a reason alluded to in your third paragraph: I often perform better on the cusp of bedtime, or any time I feel fairly exhausted, because I am less likely to be distraced, to 'have my mind wander.'

I will try the test linked some.

a bit OT but re: the different stimuli, I've noticed I react quickly to the turtle and deer stimuli, animals you might see on the road, and less quickly to polar bears and lemonade stands. Whether this is a point about conditioning or evolutionary stickiness (does that make sense?), I'm not sure.

> I often perform better on the cusp of bedtime, or any time I feel fairly exhausted, because I am less likely to be distracted, to 'have my mind wander.'

Yeah, I actually found my reaction time on the test was faster when I was not paying too close attention, when I was using my attention as relaxed wakefulness. This might be because there are switching costs; it takes time to disengage attention from the screen when the stimulus appears.

and to that point I perform best after one drink, followed by sober, and then two drinks or more. I guess after more than one drink, alcohol's impairment trumps the benefit provided by relaxation.

Consider all the things you can monitor without spending any more money. Once you have a good monitoring history, *then* think about spending money. Think of it as ""earning"" the spend versus wasting time and money on gadgets you may rarely use.

My suggestion

1. Work out what is important. 
2. Work out how to monitor those things, even if imperfecly.

If you have a mobile phone it probably has a simple sleep monitor app. 

You probably have a set of scales (for weight) and a tape measure (for waist and hips measurement - waist/hip is more important than cholesterol, weight or BMI). 

Mos mobile phone platforms have simple data recording apps eg KeepTrack for android. 

After I had been monitoring my sleep for a while I got a Zeo (company is now defunct but the monitor still works). That added some value but the basic app did 80% of the job.

It is easy to spend money but hard to follow through. So I suggest you put your seriousness about it to the test before wasting a lot of money.

To monitor exercise a simple step meter gives you a lot of data and again there are mobile phone apps that will record your runs.

I think the most important thing you need to figure out is what kind of data do you really want and how do you plan to manipulate/visualize it?  What do you specifically have in mind?  If all you care about is how much you walk then a simple pedometer is a hell of a lot cheaper and just as effective.

Personally I have a Polar Loop and a Polar Heart Rate Monitor.  I use the Loop for my daily activity tracker and basic sleeps stats and then I throw on the Heart Rate Monitor during my workouts.  For me this gives me a full view of how hard I'm working day in and day out as well as when I'm being lazy (it tells you how long you've been sitting and tells you to get off your ass).  For calories I use myfitnesspal and compare what I'm taking in with what I'm burning according to the Loop so I can make sure I'm always at a deficit.  

If I had to do it over again I'd probably opt for the Garmin Vivofit.  It can also sync to a Heart Rate Monitor but it has a better open API so it's starting to connect to more and more sites like myfitnesspal. 

See also https://forum.quantifiedself.com/thread-hello-first-off-looking-for-a-general-qs-device

The fitbit one was recalled and no longer exists, right?

For me, the most important things were automatic sleep and motion tracking, wrist worn, waterproof, and long battery life. I went with the fitbit flex.

I'd love if it (or the app) could track location over time (maybe integrate better with the Moves app), if it could be solar powered (never have to charge it), and if it recorded heart rate and glucose levels over time. I also wish the sleep tracking was a little better and more REM based instead of just logging the times you were restless or awoke in the night.

The website could have better visualizations of data as well, perhaps comparing your numbers to the numbers of the average user, or average user in your area, etc.

I'm a fan of the GoWear. I know it isn't in vogue but I needed something that was accurate, measured more than just how many steps I took and could be worn under a gi at my dojo. 

Neither Polar nor Garmin are good options if you care about access to your data: Garmin does have an API, but requires a $5,000 upfront payment. Some services might pay up, but it's going to be a lot less widely supported than more open services like BodyMedia, Fitbit, Jawbone and Withings. Also, don't expect to be able to access the data yourself.

No, the recall was for the Fitbit *Force*. The Fitbit One and the Fitbit Flex are still available.

None of the Fitbits do automatic sleep detection, i.e. you need to tell them when you're going to bed.

There isn't as much insight to be gained from comparing to ""average"" or ""similar"" users than from comparing against yourself (e.g. winter vs summer, since I changed jobs, started a new exercise routine etc).

Looks like the GoWear is the same device (or an earlier version of the same device) as the BodyMedia FIT?

How is that Basis? It looks really good!

The BodyMedia does have a temperature sensor, but you don't get access to the temperature readings unless you pay $$$ for the research version.

Not sure skin temperature is all that useful. Core temperature would be useful, but measuring that is less convenient...

I has real downsides, the band chafes and it sometimes thinks I am biking when I drive my old honda civic without AC or power steering.  

The data is locked in the website.  I use this to get it out http://www.richk.net/wiki/BasisRetriever/BasisRetriever and get nice data out, but it doesn't integrate with my fitness pal or tictrack automatically.

Overall it still has the best sensor array on the market and is a device that is more than a digital pedomenter, but it is limited by the lack of an API and the goal concepts which limit what you can have easily tracked.  The 15 goals are fine, but really typical get in shape things that do not do the best job for me.  Mostly I kinda ignore them and look at the data displays instead.

Haven't tested the Basis myself (because no official API), but many people have reported issues with the accuracy of the heart rate sensor (and therefore the calculated energy expenditure) when moving around, see e.g. [this comparison](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261955860_Validity_of_Consumer-Based_Physical_Activity_Monitors).

It matters to me specifially because I have a skin temp drop right before pain increases.  Main reason I have a wearable, but not that typical a usecase :)

Oh and also I found trends over time for body temp work to chart my menstrual cycle as long as it is at a time where your activity and environment is constant

Having the ability to make more rational choices is the main reason I collect data. Some things I learned along the way:

- Most devices and apps are designed to motivate you to get off the couch; the accuracy and usefulness of the data is secondary.

- You're much more likely to realize that something you expected to have a significant impact does in fact not, than you are to discover some amazing new ""actionable"" insight.

- Getting something useful out of your data requires a fair amount of effort: You often need to wait to have enough data, combine data from multiple sources, filter and clean up the data, and have some basic statistical literacy. Like with six-pack abs, there are no magic shortcuts :-)

See some of the screencasts I put up at https://www.youtube.com/user/zenobase to get an idea of what's involved...


I am skeptical, but interested enough I'd like to test to myself. I will continue to track as I have been and will compare what the healbe says. I'd be more confident if there were more independent field tests. 

It did well at the [CE week in New York last month]( http://healthpopuli.com/2014/06/25/the-battle-of-the-bands-digital-health-style-live-from-ceweek-in-nyc/), but again it didn't seem like they had non company ppl test.  It will be awesome if it works as described, but there's a chance it could be a ~200 mood ring :/

Thanks so much for this! It sounds like you and I have the same ideas and expectations in mind.

What devices/apps do you use?

Even if the calorie intake tracking doesn't work, it looks like a very feature rich device.

Hey u/vrimj did you happen to find a good mood tracking app with prompts? I am also looking for a more automated solution here.

It's very cool looking, but it's a lot of money for a pre-order and the first version of a product is usually the worst. Assuming it comes out without any delay or problem, I think Theranos is probably a better and cheaper choice for people who want to test themselves multiple times, but who knows when Theranos will open up anywhere outside SV / the West Coast?

For sure, I think it's a good start too. But when I look at how much money I spend on the labs versus the cost of the device, it's a very good start.

Hey Gwern, I was just reading your article on causal nets. An interesting post as always.

I admit, it might have been a bit of impulse purchase. I don't mind funding a little bit of R&D for a better product down the line. ;-) Besides, I pay a ton on labs already.

I had never heard of Theranos. Another reason to get a job in the Valley.

Thanks. I think if it pans out, it may be my most satisfying philosophical/statistical work yet: a real reason why correlation is so rarely causation and a way of estimating how often.

Theranos looks so cool, even though some of the tests I might want the most (like testosterone) are much pricier than the $1-5 range most of the media coverage like Wired highlights.

Eg mytracks for tracking my walks and runs. Once I know I route I don't use it, because I already have the information I need from it. Ditto for sleep trackers - Zeo and Sleep as Android. I know what helps me sleep and what interferes so I don't use them every day. But they are highly useful.

To succeed in difficult tasks like weight loss and fitness you need to get a lot of things right:

* A determination to succeed and confidence you will succeed.

* Awareness that it will be difficult - surprisingly important.

* A set of goals that you review regularly. It seems to work well if you have three layers of goals

 * The dream. What you want to achieve. Eg ""Be of normal weight, fit and healthy"".

 * Specific achievements with dates and measurables eg get under 120 pounds by end of 2014. It can help to apply rewards at this level. Also 'consequences'.

 * Process goals - what you are going to do to achieve your goals. This is how you actually achieve your goals. Eg walk at least 5 days a week for a total of 30 miles, have only two normal size meals a day (skip one meal) and only one alcoholic drink on 3 specific special days a year. Track compliance to your process goals. You need to use hacks to help you comply with your processes (see below). 

* Some books that might help here:

 * ""Following Through: A Revolutionary New Model for Finishing Whatever You Start"" by
Steve Levinson and Pete Greider has great hacks for getting you to follow through on your process goals. 

 * ""Succeed: How We Can Reach Our Goals"" by Heidi Grant Halvorson has some great ideas about succeeding. 

 * ""10-Minute Toughness: The Mental Training Program for Winning Before the Game Begins"" by Jason Selk puts it all together.

So in summary tracking tools can help but they are not a silver bullet.

You have exactly the right mentality here. You should take the post above and put it on Medium. Others will find it helpful.

I'm trying to rework what data I'm collecting so that it would be flexible and useful for analysis. 

At the moment I'm trying to rework how I track mood and am hoping I could get some idea of how you guys track different data too. Previously I tracked mood by choosing a category to answer the question ""How do you feel?"" with the following answers: amazing, good, neither good nor bad, good and bad,  bad, awful. It was limited and not very representative of actual mood so I've been looking at psychology books to see how they classify mood and emotions. 

I don't feel like reinventing the wheel but am hoping you guys can chime in with what apps/sites you use to track, what you track, and specifics about how you track it. If you use an app please describe how it tracks particular things out of the box or how you've tweaked it to your needs. 

I used Tickmate for Android and am currently using KeepTrack Pro. Below is what I have. 

Mood:
Reminded at specific intervals to record moods. 
Transitioning to tracking via a -5 to +5 scale based on if I feel positive or negative and same scale for energetic or lethargic. Trying to figure out if this is the best way

Sleep:
Tracked manually with a reminder notification that I need to enter data. 
Record time I go to bed, and how long I sleep, record dreams if I remember them. 

What I drink:
Record how many cups of tea I've had and how many cups of coffee. Timestamp records when I drink. Don't record the type of tea, but I should. 

Illness:
Record who in the family has been sick. Don't really have a good idea on how to track specifics such as type illness or severity. 

Fights or disagreements:
Just a yes/no response type, it's a holdover from a previous app that only allowed me to track yes/no but I want to change to track severity and positive or negative outcome.

Sex:
Track the type but thinking I should probably track outcomes as well. Time stamped to track when it happens. > Reminded at specific intervals to record moods.

I feel like this is a situation where observing something has the potential to change it a lot? Every X hours when you try to quantify your mood, you are going to bring your conscious mind into it and its capable of making stuff up and rationalizing it. For example: You're sitting on a park bench contented. Alarm goes off and you start thinking, ""Well, I'm sitting here trying not to think about that bill I have to pay tomorrow..."" Your mind was clear and your mood was content, but now you framed it against all the stuff your mind just brought to the forefront. 

Do you have a specific goal or some other purpose for all this tracking? Otherwise it can be difficult to keep up tracking for long enough to get enough data for any meaningful analysis--especially when doing manual data entry, 

Mood is a odd one I had been thinking about. I completely agree with chromaticburst point that the actual measuring will affect the moon in itself. 

Mood is odd, because you could break it down into moment of joy (they are usually short lived) and a lack of disease or stress, plus energy levels. 

I'm thinking of doing this. Tacking points I specifically worry. So I have a tally of when I catch myself worrying about something and I'm rating that worry 1-5 and moment of joy 1-5 when I note I have specifically enjoy or laughed at something. Then I'm going to try and track stress through things like heart rate (maybe). 

Then I'm going to prompt myself for measuring level of pain I'm in and how much energy I have. 

I'll also do the simple (how happy am I (I use the jawbone API and their scoring system 1-8) hopefully if I can find some clear collalations I would like to get it more automated. 

Also their is this tracking armband coming out: 

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/723246920/finally-a-wearable-device-that-can-improve-your-li

But their measuring scale doesn't look that useful (angry and excited are the same thing in their measurements). 

Hope this helps. 

I guess it depends on the person, usually my frame of mind doesn't shift that way. When I get a notification to record mood or anything like that I try to be as clinical about it as I can. Might not work for everybody but I feel it does for me.

Mostly it's to see if there are correlations between mood, caffeine consumption, sleep, etc. But also as a journaling function to look back and see if habits or preferences change over time. 

I try to make the tracking as infrequent as possible and at the same time give me meaningful data. I think I spend at most 5 minutes a day for all of my tracking which I don't think is an unsustainable amount of time. 4 months in and I actually feel I could be tracking more, and thus the question. 

I try to do my measurements at very specific points in time to track certain events.

Luckily I work a very regular schedule so my tracking takes place at the start of the work day, right before lunch, a bit after I get home, and finally close to when I go to bed.

By tracking my mood during those ""transitions"" I try to get a better idea of how work, home and the rest of the day affect my mood.  It's not a perfect methodology, but I feel it does a fairly good job of tracking my mood.

I have other trackers as well that I populate depending on the circumstances that gives me the ability to one-off concerning events.

> 4 months in and I actually feel I could be tracking more

Congratulations--most people start losing interest after 3 month, but you're asking for more :-)

Do you drink alcohol? If yes, it could be worth recording those drinks, too.

Are you using a device or app to record physical activity throughout the day (other than sex)? Physical activity can affect both mood and sleep.

Body weight is another easy-to record data point (once a day or even just once a week), though not sure if you'd have any use for it.

Don't know much about mood tracking, but am interested in apps that rely on voice analysis rather than manual input.

Personally, I think it looks cool on a first glance, and this type of technology will be really awesome ten years from now, but this initial model is going to be an utter disappointment based on the human mind's affinity for finding patterns even when there are none. After trying one I do not believe it works as claimed.

Having played with the NeuroSky MindWave, I believe this kind of device can be useful. But I don't expect to get more than a rough measure of focus and relaxation, or to be able to get useful data while moving around.

> After trying one I do not believe it works as claimed.

The claims *are* a bit overblown. For example, it says this on the main page:

>""Muse can tell the type of brain activity you’re experiencing.""

Which I think is disingenuous, in that it plays on the average person's ignorance of neuroscience. I mean, it is only a headband, positioned over a narrow region of the forehead, and can therefore only detect a very small amount of brain activity in a very specific region of the brain. Even if we assume that it's doing that properly (remember: laypeople are going to be ""placing the electrodes"" and individuals have different sized/shaped heads), then we also have to assume that neuroscience has a firm understanding of what brain activity in that region means, which is at least debatable.

All of your points exactly. It is a neat technology, but sales will be based on people who do not understand the severe limitations of the device.

I have a background in neuroscience and have worked with EEG in research. I have also meditated for several years and have a relatively acute sense of when I am calm. This device, when I used it, could not even ascertain accurately whether I was calm or not. Additionally, the electrodes are on the forehead right above the eyes; even with advanced offline algorithms and use of simultaneous eye-tracking technology correcting for eye-movement artefacts can be messy.

As much as I want future progress in the domain of consumer EEG, I would tell anyone I know not to purchase this product. If one uses ""snake oil"" to describe a quack medicine, what does one call a quack device? Perhaps head-mounted ""dowsing-rod""?

Maybe. On the other hand, I'm not sure that there's anything to explain.

I was looking for portable polysomnography units online and it turns out they cost an arm and a leg. So, I figure, maybe an EEG monitor would work just as well, or that and an ECG? Anyone with any experience doing this in their own home or professionally with inexpensive portable units?

I've seen recommendations on things like the ZEO (as opposed to say the fitbit..) but I've also heard that it's bunk. The zeo is excellent (I can only vouch for the bedside one, since I've not played with the raw data outputted by the mobile, if it even can output raw data). The only downside is that they're hard to come by now that the company has closed down, and you'll be relying on headbands that are no longer being manufactured.

You can track sleep almost as accurately with wrist actigraphy, and indeed many of the companies which sell sleep tracking devices, eg fitbit, have done studies which compare their device's sleep tracking with PSG, which is considered the ""gold standard"" in sleep tracking. They've managed to stage sleep as well as measure duration, interruptions, and ""quality"" with something like 98% accuracy. 

I own a Zeo bedside, a Fitbit One, a Basis B1, and a Pebble which I use with Sleep as an Android. The Fitbit (set to ""sensitive""), Basis and Zeo all give very similar results for sleep duration and quality.

The Fitbit One doesn't work for me: It either tells me that I slept like a brick (normal setting), or that I didn't sleep much at all (sensitive setting).

The BodyMedia FIT produces more plausible-looking numbers (and doesn't need to be told when I go to bed and when I get up), but I don't expect it to be very accurate, either. YMMV.

The current ""scientific"" consensus on actigraphy appears to be that it's suitable for detecting serious sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea, but not accurate enough to distinguish sleep phases.


My main concern with actigraphy is that I sleep with someone else and I don't want them throwing off my readings. My secondary concerns are that I want may want to track my brain waves during non-sleep periods also (if I have the option to do so) and while sleeping in a hammock or waterbed, which may move. 

You used the devices simultaneously for tracking? if that's the case I'll be fine using a Zeo or Fitbit for now. 

Is [this](http://www.amazon.com/Zeo-ZEOBP01-Personal-Sleep-Manager/dp/B002IY65V4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1401300473&sr=8-1&keywords=zeo) the bedside version you were talking about? 

Have you tried the Zeo? I know it doesn't operate using acitgraphy. 

I've never compared a Zeo/Fitbit/Basis to a PSG, but I've compared them to each other and they're always within a few minutes of each other for sleep tracking.

The Basis is neat because it records heart rate as well as actigraphy, and your heart rate isn't going to be thrown off by someone else sleeping in bed with you. Also, one could argue that if someone moving in bed with you causes you to move your arm, then that should be counted as a sleep disturbance and measured accordingly.

Didn't get to test the Zeo before they went out of business. I'd expect it to be more accurate. But I also remember reading about someone who did a video recording of their sleep, and that didn't quite match up with what the Zeo was reporting.

I'm curious if either the Muse or the Melon headband can be used to track sleep--both devices are supposed to ship sometime this year.

sounds like a great price for what it is.  i'd buy it if i weren't tight on money.  my insurance gets me a lot of tests for free, so i will stick to that.

Not sure about the value of regular testing outside of annual medical check-ups. But the low cost of each test ($2-5?) would make QS experiments such as ""how much and how soon does time spent outdoors affect my vitamin D levels"" affordable.

The test ~~strips~~ cartridges are going to be single use and sold separately from what I understand. Still amazing if they make it happen. They seem to have a competent technical team from UCLA so I have high hopes.

I see what your saying, but on the other hand I have wanted most of these tests at different points of my life, so having a device that makes it easy to take the tests (in addition to more tests in the future) is exciting.

Yeah there is more information in the FAQ section.

Sleep Cycle can export your data as a CSV file.

I believe it does. I haven't tried exporting the data yet, but that's a good idea. I can use those linear regression skills I learned in school.

A lot of the data I found confirmed what I initially thought. I think it is more effective to limit the variables that have a negative impact on my sleep like caffeine before bed, having more than a couple drinks, and having too much exposure to artificial light before bed.

The Fitbit One is as accurate as a pedometer can be; avoid wristbands if accurate step counts are more important to you than being hip.

he was killed by the vegan lobby

Well... likely ""too soon"" - but Seth himself would only welcome such questions, since he questioned everything himself (especially anything considered ""established fact""). Moreover since many of us followed his suggestions, I am sure we all want to avoid what might have caused his premature death. My guess: copious butter consumption http://betabeat.com/2014/04/seth-roberts-final-column-butter-makes-me-smarter/ 

A big loss for the quantified-self community; I loved his blog.

Doubt it was the butter.  This is speculation, but someone in the comments also chimed in that very high omega-3 can cause bleeding/hemorrhaging in the brain, and he was taking huge amounts of flax and may have underestimated the O3 amounts.

Hmm, that article says that the increased butter in his diet was correlated with a reduced risk of heart attack according to two Agatston scores. Maybe it had a non-heart effect?

My first thought was butter, which is one of the things he does that really rubs me the wrong way. But if butter were the culprit, then the proposed mechanism would be coronary atherosclerosis - however, Seth did before and after heart scans showing no progression of his coronary atherosclerosis with increased butter consumption, and in fact showed some regression. Not saying he didn't have a heart attack (I think he did), but if he did, I think we have fair evidence that butter didn't cause it.

A lot of people are thinking brain bleed secondary to omega 3's thinning the blood, however you wouldn't generally expect someone to collapse, the onset of symptoms would be more gradual. If someone drops unconscious it's pretty much going to be the heart. And in a 60 year old, the obvious answer is heart attack.

Yes, maybe the more likely candidate. I know this is the last thing to concern his family right now - but it would be useful if they eventually release any info regarding his cause of death. 

Seth's heart plaque was improved dramatically after a year of eating butter; the test results showed a level of improvement that is rare:

I have a Zeo (RIP)  Bedside and a stash of replacement headbands. I've yet to find a suitable replacement and have just been stashing the data for a rainy day. 

So far I've found the Basis Health Tracker:

http://www.amazon.com/Basis-Health-Tracker-Fitness-Stress/dp/B00GJG5ZEA/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top

It measures heart rate, so it can automatically detect sleep. It's not so good for heart rate while moving, but I'm okay with that.

I've also found this, which is a bit more expensive than the Basis, but looks medical grade:

http://www.clinicalguard.com/id/wristband-pulse-oximeter-octivetech-300w-for-sleep-study--p-177.html?gclid=CLvdve_Ggb4CFaN9OgodFCsAvQ

There is no visualization software, so you'll have to process the data on your own.

How does detecting heart rate enable it to detect sleep? 

I've been using this. It's not as good as my zeo, and I can't validate it against this because my zeo died a year or so ago, but it gives some data.

Seeing how much weight you are losing graphed out day by day is highly motivating and helps you establish how healthy your weight losing habits are (doctors say that a healthy weight loss is about 1-2 pounds per week).

Seeing how much you can run in one sitting, how much weight you can lift with one particular form, how fast you are at a given thing, how your cardio holds up, seeing all these things mapped out over time helps you to further progress at a quicker pace.



For me it was and is still a game changer. It explained why my weight fluctuates so much in just a couple of months.

I find that a little bit too invasive to do on a nightly basis, so I was thinking if there is a way to monitor inactivity of the phone during night.

Android already has good pedometer apps that run in the background (like Accupedo and that Samsung Pedometer app), all day long, every day, but they don't also track sleep time.

Basically, for 6-7 hours every night the phone is completely motionless and charging. That would be easy to log and non-invasive. Being non-invasive leads to better chances of capturing data year-long and analyzing trends.

(I also heard about SleepCycle trashing the phone battery and problems with keeping the phone on all night - might be an iPhone issue. Phones are falling from beds and people don't generally do it for years on end because of the hassle.)None of these apps require you to keep the phone on the bed--you just won't get proper sleep efficiency or sleep cycle data if you don't.

But it sounds like you want an app that simply logs all periods where the phone is plugged in (and not moving), so you don't need to remember to start/stop the sleep logging?

do you have a source for the app causing battery issues?  If it causes damage to the battery I am going to rethink my use of a similar app.

In other words, if you don't keep it on your bed, it doesn't work right.

So, in other words, OP is right.  

Please don't be that guy. 2 million 4^th grade pedants on the internet is already sufficient. :-) 

Not being pedantic: Having a record of what time you went to bed (and how long you staid in bed) is valuable on its own. I use a Fitbit to record sleep times, but don't bother wearing it at night because it's too cumbersome and not accurate. Don't see any reason why apps like SleepCycle or Sleep as Android can't be used in a similar manner.

Apologies - this is somewhat of a thread-jack.

Sometime in the first half of 2013, well before Reporter was released, I created a personal web app (no time and/or skills to develop a mobile app) that seems to do similar things, at least as far as data collection goes.

Here's a few [screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/xvKfEXz). It's quite basic and self explanatory.

I've redacted text and the url (because privacy). The redacted text is a subset of previously entered data, ordered by frequency. Nothing is mandatory except coordinates - which are obtained via geo API.

BTW, the screenshot doesn't show it, since I'm reworking that aspect, but I also have a Wake Up/Falling Asleep button and a section for dreams.

Briefly, it's annoying and difficult to get into the habit of entering data, and more so because I have to launch it manually. I'd venture Reporter might suffer from a similar issue of request overload.  
This isn't really tracking many useful things OR it needs better reporting and visualisations - I don't know enough. It needs to be more in-depth and robust to be useful.  
It doesn't encourage me to change my behaviour - a chart isn't enough.

I've got more learnings, but that would be a really bad case of thread-jacking.  

---
So, yeah, I'd be interested in a similar app myself, but it's got to resolve issues I mentioned (and others that I haven't) before it'll be worth it. Does Reporter address these?

Can anyone chime in with their experiences?

***

We are a research team from George Washington University, and we're seeking volunteers to track their sleep patterns using an Android app called ""Drowzy"". The app was developed by two clinician researchers: a board certified psychiatrist, and a sleep medicine specialist. The primary focus of Drowzy is measuring sleep efficiency, which specialists generally agree is the most important measure of sleep quality.

Sleep efficiency is the ratio of time asleep to time in bed trying to sleep. Researchers have found that sleep efficiency is strongly linked to satisfaction with both nighttime sleep and daytime wakefulness. Sleep efficiency appears to be even more important than the total number of hours slept.

Entering data into Drowzy takes less than 1 minute per day. The app provides:

Graphs of sleep efficiency and satisfaction.

Tabular displays of detailed sleep data.

An option to email data and graphs to a doctor or therapist.

The ability to download all your data formatted as a CSV file (spreadsheet).

Evidence-based recommendations on improving sleep.

Specialized key pads that allow data to be entered fast.

***

Our goal is to gather data from thousands of people so we can better understand:

How sleep is influenced by age, gender, medical illness, bedroom environment, latitude, and the presence or absence of a bed partner.

How seasonal changes affect sleep. What is the effect of latitude differences?

How daylight savings time affects sleep.

The relationship between sleep efficiency and satisfaction in a broad population sample to compliment the smaller studies that have already been published.

As data begins to accumulate, additional analyses will included. We would be grateful for suggestions from people who have used the app, and are familiar with the data being collected. Our contact information is on the Drowzy app download page on Google Play.

Although insomnia affects millions of people, and has been associated with psychological problems, increased blood pressure, and even heart attacks, sleep still remains a mystery. With a critical mass of people contributing to this study, we will be able to assemble a large database that will help shed light on this essential aspect of human behavior. Please visit [www.drowzy.com](http://www.bestpracticecare.com/Drowzy/), or [download Drowzy on Google Play.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gwupsychiatry.gwsd) What's the difference between this and sleep as android?

I'm a data scientist at [Practice Fusion](http://www.practicefusion.com), a free web-based electronic health record company based in SF.  My team is made up of a combination of software engineers, epidemiologists, data scientists, and data visualization-ists.  Much of the team is also on reddit (I typically post under a different account, so I swear I have more than 1 karma point... for whatever that's worth), and also participates in various Quantified Self events.

We're currently hiring a [Data Scientist](http://www.practicefusion.com/careers/jobs/data-scientist.html), [Full Stack Engineer](http://www.practicefusion.com/careers/jobs/full-stack-product-engineer-data-sciences.html), and [Data Analyst](http://www.practicefusion.com/careers/jobs/data-analyst.html).  We like people who are passionate about data and various aspects of health care... so, naturally, we like other people who are involved in the QS movement.

If you have any questions, or are interested but hesitating for whatever reason, feel free to comment, message me, or email me (jschrom@practicefusion.com).  Thanks!I'm in the UK. Am I disqualified?

Can I ask if you all have a data quality analyst, or dedicated data steward, or is that part of your data analysts/scientist roles?  

Its common in the customer and product domain, but have been wondering how that is done in big data shops.  Best of luck on your search, that looks like a pretty sweet culture.

We have sponsored visas in the past, and we do pay reloc (although probably not quite enough to fully fund an international move).  I think it depends on your skill set, and those of other candidates... feel free to shoot me an email (jschrom@practicefusion.com) with your resume and I'll check in with our recruiter :)

Data stewards and, in general, data governance is a really important part of any company that has a lot of data.  In a hospital (where I've worked in the past), the CMIO would more or less decree how data should be structured and entered... but, with a free product that's used by many different providers throughout the US, we can't just decree how they use it.

There's a team that generally manages the flow of data through the organization.  We (data science team, and specifically me) manage our own process also where we work on cleaning data we know is not correctly entered, and provide better structure to the unstructured data.  So, ultimately, when we build data products or do analysis, we feel confident that it's clean and accurate.

So, the role of data steward is one that falls within our team... mostly among the data scientists within the team.

Thank you for the detailed answer. My current role is in data governance, and I deal with on premise-data mainly- but looking forward I have been wondering how that works for a big data scenario.

Maybe my original comment was unfair. I found the preset questions to be few in number and not very insightful(""How'd you sleep? How many cups of coffee did you have today?)

 I suppose I'd hoped that the apps creator had applied his years of quantified selfing into choosing questions that had the most impact when viewed against one another.  You can of course, create your own survey questions. 

It does tap into your accelerometer, location, calendar, photo data as well. I imagine it might expand to draw more heavily from social networks if it had a huge budget- facebook-level word scanning- hah.

Not Bashing them Though, i really like the idea, it just needs a ton more research, and testing done before i'd use it as my only source of energy. But its is promising and looks like good momentum for the future of food.

Edit: A good example is Creatine. Your Body makes some and get some from your foods (Meats + Fish). Now, since your not getting any now, and your body has to make it all now, does your body now need more Materials to make it or do you supplement it. 

Why would you rather eat a fortified slim-fast instead of healthy/real food?  Just because it has a good nutrition profile doesn't it has high bio-availability.  I would much rather take the extra hour a day to make wholesome, healthy, delicious/nutritious meals than drink what is basically slim-fast with a multivitamin mixed into it.  Not to mention it lacks enough cholesterol (which is vital for the production of ALL hormones.)

The way I see it, the only people this will be good for is people who have barely enough time in their day to make a protein shake every time they get hungry.  This is NOT an optimal ""meal replacement"" if your end goal is ultimate brain/body function and health.

I've been wearing a Basis B1 for about a year and /u/dpwalsh/ makes extremely valid points. Originally posted about this last year here (http://redd.it/16mdis)

Would love to see several improvements:

* Better battery life. First generation wearable devices have drawbacks, and this is one of them. At best the battery lasts for three and a half days. Bump this up to 7 days and I'm completely in love. In the meantime it's like having range anxiety in an electric car.
* Incorporate swim tracking features similar to the walking/running/biking workout monitoring. Certainly cannot be more difficult than the aforementioned kinetics, especially since one would spike the perspiration sensors immediately.
* Reminders/notifications that encourage you to meet or beat your goals on a regular schedule. Often times I find myself forgetting to go for an afternoon walk, or to get up and stretch once an hour. Working in an office is nice, but often times I need the extra motivation/reminder to meet daily objectives.
* Durability. I hope the next evolution incorporates durable steel/titanium/glass. Personal health devices are anywhere from $200~300, but folks would gladly pay for more durable materials. First week I scratched the face and snapped the ""Carbon Steel Strap"" which FYI is neither carbon fiber... or steel. Frankly it's LESS durable than the basic bands as there are more points of potential breakage/failure.
* Aesthetics are downright awful. I catch hell for wearing a cheesy Casio watch from the 80's. Beggars can't be choosers, but I think the Pebble 2.0 is moving in the right direction.
* Open access to the raw sensor data. Mostly for nerds, but some of us like to hack our devices. In the meantime you can get the Basis B1 data export script here: (http://www.quantifiedbob.com/2013/04/liberating-your-data-from-the-basis-b1-band.html)

Hope the Basis team is listening to what we're saying!! =D Feedback is always appreciated!!

Basis is extremely unreliable as a quantified self device. The heart rate monitoring is laughable: http://www.digitalmcgyver.com/personal/gadgets/basis-and-heart-rate-monitoring/

I had a basis for close to a month and decided to return it - sticking with a simple Fitbit. Biggest problem for me was the lack of Bluetooth 4 (meaning sync is a pain and battery drain for both the watch and phone). While the Fitbit is a glorified pedometer I think Version 2 of what Basis will produce will be the one worth getting.

It's a pain in the butt carrying those devices around, so I want to buy a wrist based HRM, knowing that the accuracy might not be as good.  So far the Basis watch is leading the pack, but I want to know if I can get some decent data from it, as I don't care at all for cards or awards on their website.

The problem with wrist-based HRM (incl the Basis) is that they often don't fit your wrist well, so you get bad readings when you move around.

I'm not sure if it's possible to obtain raw data from the Basis B1.

I've owned it for a year and until there's an open API I think you're out of luck.

Hopefully things change because I really like the device... Battery life is my only complaint thus far.

I've since found a script that may work from Quantified Bob

FWIW, here's what they have to say about the current state of glucose measurement technology:

>Although some people wear glucose monitors with a glucose sensor embedded under their skin, all people with diabetes must still prick their finger and test drops of blood throughout the day.

A low-tech way might be to use the ketone urine test strips, which often have glucose test aswell.

You could photograph the result and record the colour, relative to pure white/black.

Inacurate but cheap.

Actually I think meters are affordable, if you don't mind pin pricks.

I wanted to do the same thing!

After some research, I found that Accu-Chek FastClix lancing device [2] was one of the best lancing devices, and I've found that the prick induces only a tiny amount of pain. The kit [1] I bought has the lance, the meter, and some strips and it's only $12! Good luck

Yeah, for a non-diabetic, non-starving person, you'd usually just see trace ketones, which isn't too informative.

Yes, the ketone test may not be useful, but some have a second patch to test glucose.

Does anyone here use it, or can recommend something like it?I use the Fitbit Force and I like it. I bought one as soon as it was released so I'm not aware of the bad reviews. 

I initially had my eye on the Flex, but decided to wait for the Force because I liked the display. Overall, I'm content with the purchase. My biggest complaint is manually tracking activities other than running/walking and diet tracking, although I honestly haven't put in much time to set them up properly.

If I were still in the market for a tracker, I would wait for some of the wearables announced at CES to hit the shelves. 

If you have more specific questions about it, I would be happy to answer them.

I've had one for a month now.
It's ok, it does what it says it will, but not much more. It's a fancy step counter basically.
The sleep tracking system is not very accurate in my case and I have no idea how it calculates calories although the numbers seem reasonable for high activity days and low.
Screen adds a watch and a little shortcut to the 5 data points it gathers, but costs you waterproofness.
Slight improvement over the jawbone up, and hopeful that next generation of these toys will have more pulse stuff and blood pressure etc.

I got one for Christmas and love it, but it's the only type of product like this that I've tried.  It really has made me rethink my eating and exercising habits.  The website and app work pretty well too.

I actually didn't want one on a watchband, but I'm really glad I have it now.  I always remember to wear it and I'm able to check calories burned the same way I would check the time.  The only thing that's a little iffy about it is that the watch band doesn't seem to hold together great, but I actually haven't had any problems with it.

I haven't had any of the skin conditions that have been well publicized lately.

I've had one for almost a month and am digging it.  You have to understand what it does and does not do -- but what it does, it does well.  It's stylish and functional enough to wear as a watch, it has a readout you can use to see how you're doing on steps -- something i do many times a day and that really keeps me aware of it (and I use this much more than the companion app), and it just works quietly in the background for a long time on a single charge.

It does not measure your pulse, etc.  But it integrates well with other apps, such as myfitnesspal, which i use to log meals (and which also sucks in runkeeper, which i use to track exercise sessions like runs, withings scale, etc.), so it fits a real gap for me.

One of my favorite less-commented-on features is that you can set vibrate-to-wake alarms, which allow me to wake up early (in theory, to exercise) without waking my wife.

I waited around a while while deciding what to get, and overall I'd say, at the price point, just get one and see how you like it -- that's certainly better than not.

How useful is the ""activity tracker""? I'm looking for something that can measure effort while I'm playing basketball or doing cardio, and a sleep tracker. It also would be nice to not have to wear it like a watch.

The activity tracker allows you to manually log general activity like running, biking, basketball, or aerobics and estimates your calorie burn. If you do more specific exercises, like weightlifting or circuit training, where your calorie burn can vary greatly depending on the exercises, it is probably less useful in that regard.

The sleep tracker has a ""normal"" and ""sensitive"" setting. Normal setting says I sleep great. Sensitive setting says I sleep like shit. I keep mine on ""sensitive"" and it seems consistent.

The settings allow you to chose dominant or non-dominant hand for wearing positions. If you want to wear it elsewhere, I would suggest looking at the Fitbit One wireless tracker or the Withings equivalent. They do the same thing as the Force, but allow you to clip it to other parts of your clothes. The Withings also has a pulse reader built in. In hindsight, I should have gone with a clip on. I would have bought the Withings if it had an Android app a few months ago. I'll be surprised if my Force lasts a year from the abuse it sees at my job.

The BodyMedia FIT armband measures effort (plus it's more convenient for tracking sleep).


Don't you need a subscription for the service though?

Yes, take that into account when comparing prices. The other caveat is that they haven't updated their devices or app since their acquisition by Jawbone. Still, it's one of the more useful devices if you're after data rather than badges. Opinion on Fitbit Force?

Last year I began working with a super-talented team on a project that is very close to my heart. We began with a single question that grew into a mission and spawned a company. That question was: how do you quantify your mood and energy? That eventually grew into a mission to help make the quantified self movement more about your decisions and habits, and less about the numbers.

I'm proud to introduce to the Reddit community the Lume Personal Tracker. Think of it as a data-driven journal that's designed to help you visualize your mood and energy. Use the simple and intuitive interface to record mood and energy data. Add a text entry to give your data an additional layer of meaning and context. Motivate yourself to track regularly by setting daily, weekly, or monthly goals. Take a moment each day to reflect on your well-being, and record it using Lume. The more you record, the easier it is to see trends in your behavior.

Lume is FREE and available for devices running iOS 6 or later.

Since this is version 1 for us, there was some functionality that we had t o leave on the cutting room floor. However, we will continue expanding the app’s utility with forthcoming updates. Users can look forward to several new key features that will enhance their experience with the app:

* Add location data to a journal entry
* See your journal entries on the graph view
* Set “Checkup” alerts and reminders to track
* Expanded graphing and visualizations
* Backup, export and sync your data.

Further updates will include additional modules for tracking various aspects of your fitness, such as diet, weight, and activity tracking (running, cycling, step counting).

This is an attempt to provide a holistic approach to health - one that takes into account mental health in addition to physical health. Download Lume and help us improve our understanding of personal health.

Thanks so much for your help!

This looks really interesting. By ""sync your data"" are you referring to the ability to connect to your service from other services and apps to import the data? Being able to see how mood relates to other facets of life is incredibly valuable.

This looks pretty slick! One thing I'm wondering though is how it's different from other journaling apps. For example, I use DayOne a lot...is this a complement, a substitute?

Why is this not available outside of the US app store? I live in Spain and have a spanish credit card and therefore the Spanish App Store, and I can't search it on my iPhone, and can't install it via iTunes!

iPad?

Yes! I can't give any definite timelines, but we're aiming for the year's end.

Not quite, but that is something we're working on!

For now, our version of syncing will allow you to keep your data consistent across multiple devices through the use of a secure remote server. We're also working on export functionality, so that you can export a CSV or Excel version of your data.

I hope the fact that we lack this functionality doesn't keep you from giving our app a try!  :)

Great question. The main difference between our app and one such as Day One is the core focus. I use Day One as well, and I love it. I've found it works exceptionally well as a journal to which I can add supplementary data - weather, steps, location, etc. However, I can't really keep track of my mood or energy in any meaningful way other than writing about it.

You can consider Lume the inverse of that. The core of Lume is data tracking. The journaling aspect is meant to compliment the data you collect about yourself. This way, when you're reviewing your week, it's not such a mystery why you were in a bad mood on Thursday, which is usually your best day (for the sake of this example). For now, the types of data you can collect are limited to mood and energy, but soon we'll expand the types of data tracked to include diet, activity, and weight.

For now you can consider it a compliment, but eventually we'd like for it to be a substitute for whatever combination of apps you may be using to achieve this goal.  ;)

Does this answer your question?

It will run on the iPad, but in compatibility mode. An iPad version is something we'd definitely like to address.

Tracking the fight with my girlfriend help us to see more clearly the recurring problems and find ways to solve them.

Overall it's making me more aware of my patterns and my behaviours.

For some time I recorded any significant error I made.  It showed me that I have a tendency to trust my instincts without checking them, and also that I'm totally bad at time management.

I'm more mindful about intuition based decisions, and I try to use a diary more.  Still struggling with time though.

Tracking my Bristol stool scale records over six months reassured me that my digestive output really is as variable and resistant to simple trends analysis as I'd been suspecting. 

Not sure how down with the movement your lady would be but I've used the app ""iP"" (short for iPeriod I think). To track my female's menstruation's before. Length, duration, etc. Definitely had a [Beautiful Mind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvO_78fajxY) moment when I realized that all our major ""arguments"" fell within the roughly three same days of her cycle. After that I figured out the pattern & could could discuss things with my most beloved friend rather than entering into verbal combat with a blood thirsty maniac.

If you don't think PMS or PMDD is a major driving force in the behavior of most females, because hormones don't dictate women's behaviors. Ask yourself; do I believe in roid rage? Not quite the same thing but I think it's the male equivalent. Kinda not their fault because nature dealt them a crappy hand, but also not a get out of jail free card (roid rage isn't really a valid legal defense).

Good luck brother & choose your battles well. You won't win many & most aren't worth fighting with a female (I'd rather say ""okay I understand"" than offer a logical explanation why I did something to a human whose brain is not generally governed by logic).

Such a good idea! I'll experiment with that to see whether I can keep up with the discipline.

As a female- this is a great idea! As much as I try to be aware and warn my husband that I'm in the zone of emotional/irrational days, by the nature of the beast I can forget. I'm still newish in QS, this is something definitely worth tracking. Ty!  

If you use Android, TapLog is very useful for this.   I used a five star severity rating and text.

I'm totally starting that again, I only stopped when I changed job.

I was thinking about this some more, and I completely missed the complimentary opportunity to log occurrences of good judgement.

I think every time something works our really well, or intuition aces a situation, it would be worth examining why too.  More so in fact.

What else could I track? One requirement is easiness of tracking e.g. I do not track calorie intake as it is too much work. I want the collecting  to be automated for the most part.

It might look like a lot but I spend less than 30 minutes a week gathering these data. So it's not very hard to maintain the discipline.

I'm also working on a complete list of the [tools available for self-tracking](http://www.quantifiedguide.com). It's called the [Quantified Guide](http://www.quantifiedguide.com). It's still in its infancy but you might find some inspiration for other stuff to track.

Also, I don't know if you use [Moves](http://www.moves-app.com), but it's really a great app. I lot of insight can be extracted from these data.

How about:
- Time on the computer (RescueTime)
- Travel time to work 

I'm interested in how and were you are storing and displaying that data. Do you have a dashboard?

I work on an app called Saga, which does effortless location tracking. It requires less effort than foursquare, and is more accurate since it tracks everywhere you go - not just the places you check in to. It also provides you with summaries of your data, such as the amount of time you spend at home / work / various other venues, and what your typical commutes look like. Oh, and we have a data export feature, so you can get a dump of your data and do your own analysis.

Check us out! Free on Android and iOS, etc.

You can track blood glucose, it's cumbersome but not very expensive. Fasting glucose would probably be the most useful. The readers today are like 8 bucks on amazon, the lancets and chips cost like 10 cents per use. 

It's not an everyday thing to measure but people should probably measure it more than every now and again like the doctors do. If it's high it's good motivation to do some [HIIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training).

There's a similar guide at [experimentable.com](http://experimentable.com/qs-guide/); could serve as additional reference.

Only the date?


> Polar H7

Do you use Polar's own app, or a third-party app with your Polar H7? Do you record your heart rate during exercise, or also at rest?

Good ideas.

So far it is more or less scattered across various services and there export files (mostly either csv or spreadsheets). 

Are you guys going to implement a website that allows you to acces your data anytime soon? The app is nice, but you can do more with a website.

You've got a lot of good features and good design, but for me Moves wins because of its ability to automatically identify cycling, walking and running. Are you working on anything like that?

I use the Polar H7 with :

**Buddha Mind** : To track my HRV during meditation.

**Strava** : To track my cycling, running and ski

**Polar Beat** : For other sports or other experiments

I would really like to have my heart beat at any given time but apart from sports and meditation, I seldom wear it. I find it too cumbersome to wear it all day and at night and I have an issue with changing the battery every week or so.

We definitely want to put together a web portal soon (I've certainly been pushing for this!). It's on the roadmap, but we're working on some other cool stuff at the moment. Stay tuned!

Evernote Hello fulfils my own needs for tracking social contacts. 

The android app AIRS can log the Bluetooth devices around you. It would take some work to clean up the data (remove computers, etc) but it would be an indicator of being around other people. 

The app can also log noise level, noise pitch and GPS. So you may be able to see if you were in a conversation using the noise level and pitch. Using the pitch and GPS you could filter out other loud environments.(Train, fan,etc). 

There's also a mood widget to the app and you could add a ""social"" mood to the widget. Then, at least until you are able to solely use the GPS and noise level to indicate being social, select the social mood when appropriate and when you look at the data you can find patters in the data with the mood ""social"".

I don't think caring *more* about socializing is going to solve your problem.

If number of texts is a good proxy for socialization for you there is a neat visualization app (Mac) called [Prism](http://prismviz.com/) that visualizes iPhone texting history. I've used it a few times to check out patterns and my texting history. 

Just tried it out. It seems okay for meeting new people but not so good for keeping up with acquantances. I have some Facebook friends that I've only met once or twice and would like to have them as a semi-regular part of my social circle. However, I found it difficult to import contacts from Facebook, despite the fact that they were easy to find on my phone's built-in contact app.

Excel (or google docs) is going to get you a very long way, and is robust, accessible and really rather fantastic.

However, if you have a very large data set, sheets stop being fun.
If you want to process several thousands of row, and start doing functions on slices, etc, pivot tables will help.

I used to capture weather data, and power data, and it start to accumulate.   I tried sqlite, whichis good actually, but ended up using mysql because I had it running anyway.


I just use flat text files. For the most part, more complex tools like SQL aren't going to be worth the overhead.

Tictrac is the best platform out there for Quantified Self. It also allows for data export of all of your data if you want to play with Excel ;)

For quick prototypes, I'd recommend Google Forms/Spreadsheets. Once you get started coding, I'd recommend MongoDB or any other with flexible schema, as it reduces setup time.

Have you tried https://zenobase.com/? It's geared towards personal time-series data, so it's less flexible than a general-purpose database or Excel, but it's more flexible than comparable services that have a more narrow focus.

And excel annoys me.

Recently I discovered that Microsoft is giving away Visual Studio free and I've been working on an app to help me with music production.

It just occurred to me that I could write up my own tracking app, because I'm not seeing anything out there that really suits my needs.  

Basically I want to track the following:
* time that I wake up or go to sleep
* time that I, what I eat, and how many calories
* times when I take my medications
* logging anything that I ingest otherwise, namely vitamins, supplements, occasional rec drugs

Beyond that I'm thinking of perhaps implementing some kind of pomodomo type thing into it, having it pop up an alert every so often, perhaps to have you click on something to rate your mood, keep some kind of historical log of what you're doing.  

Like for example, am I redditing, am I youtubing, am I educating myself about a particular topic, am I just gabbing with friends, am I writing code, am I working on music, am I playing a video game or watching tv/movie, etc.

The thing is for me I'm just at home almost all the time, I go to the gym a lot and sometimes go to some art classes and stuff, but otherwise I'm generally glued to the computer.  And I have serious ADHD so it's hard for me to keep track of time.

I don't want to be spending all my time redditing (leechblock has helped with that) or whatever other kinds of stuff, I want to be spending a % of my time working on music, a % learning, a % socializing, a % having fun...

So I'm hoping I can come up with a good way to not only track what I'm actually doing but also keep me on track with what I'm wanting to do.

I would like to share this app with others, probably freeware or donationware, so if you would like to see such an app let me know.  I would like it to be flexible enough to where one could input the things that matter to them, and make it super easy to do ubiquitous capture, while also reminding you to get stuff done.

If it becomes ""a thing"" I'm not opposed to making a web-based sync or perhaps porting to droid/ios but I'm trying to avoid allowing the entreprenuer streak in me to let loose again because I find music production much more fulfilling and fun overall than running a business.  

I just haven't found a ""killer app"" that works well for my personality type.  My IQ seems to fluxuate between 90 and 150 depending on a variety of physiological factors that I have trouble connecting the dots with.  And when my brain is working 100%, it is really hard for me to focus on anything other than being as productive on the project I'm working on as possible, to where tracking stuff seems like a nuisance.  But when I'm not at 100% then I lack the information to determine what's missing to get me back there.

If I can have an app that helps with the ubiquitous capture and formats it in a way that's useful to see long-term trends that will help a lot.  and what would be even better is if it can not only capture but also ""nudge"" me along to focus on what I need to do, or remind me of what I'm trying to do.
You are describing the holy grail, my friend. I've been struggling with the same thing. I think most QSers are. 

How do you plan to log time awake / sleep, vitamins ingested, etc? If manually, then I have a ""solution"" for you, but you'll probably succumb to the cognitive overload of always remembering to input everything like I did.

If you want automatic recording, then you'll need to start diving into sensors and devices. You'll need a way to get them all to play nicely as well. Tictrac.com seems to be the best QS data aggregator to date.

Good luck! Keep us posted. If you figure it out, I'll be the first in line to buy your app.

>How do you plan to log time awake / sleep, vitamins ingested, etc? If manually, then I have a ""solution"" for you, but you'll probably succumb to the cognitive overload of always remembering to input everything like I did.

i've been using OneNote for this, since i'm at the computer most of the time.  and when i'm away from it then i use this diary app i downloaded for my kindle paperwhite to log stuff.

With the app, i plan to have it pop up every so often, like every hour or 4 hours or whatever (probably will make it configurable) and just ask you log stuff about the time in between when it was last run.  It will require some energy to configure initially (like determining what data points one should capture), but it shouldn't take more than a few seconds to click a couple boxes and have it disappear back into the background.

Maybe i can add some scripting ability and an API to make it easier to integrate with whatever devices are out there.  hell if anyone wants me to add a particular device, they could send me their device as payment and i could get it working natively with it.

I am in my dietetic internship and the hospital I am working in is letting me wear a CGM through Tuesday morning. The CGM allows me to track my blood glucose levels throughout the day, and I plan on following some LG principles for a few of the days. I'll keep a food log with meals and times and should be able to provide graphs showing how my blood glucose changes during the fast, feed, and during exercise. The study is blind so I won't be able to upload results until after the trial ends on Tuesday. Here's a picture of the sensor. http://i.imgur.com/fvfJGd3.jpg

**Update**

**10/26**
So after 1 day finger sticks have showed a range of 20 points(70-90 mg/dL) so not too exiting, but all testing occurred at least 2 hrs after meals/during the fast. I'm using these tests to calibrate the CGM, so I probably won't do finger sticks when blood glucose might be changing rapidly. Diet was a little weird today due to a family party. Ill go into the details and meal timing once I have the graphs from cgm.

**Well the data has been compiled and drum roll... My pancreas doesn't wait to make insulin/my liver thinks it is cool if I run a little lean. I have many images with diets overlaid and some with average data. I was slightly hypoglycemic (<70mg/dL) almost nightly which probably has something to do with hormone levels changing during sleep and my large evening meals. Monday was a rest day/low carb day and my blood glucose dropped below 70 on 8 occasions 3-4 of which occurred after my first meal.**

Which CGM is this? How comfortable was it? 

Obviously CGMs can offer significant value to diabetics, but the interstitial fluid based sensors (which is what you had based on the need to calibrate with finger pricks) always seemed too invasive for an incomplete solution.

It looks like you were hypoglycemic pretty much every night.  Did you have trouble sleeping?

Medtronic ipro2 with the enlite sensor. It wasn't too bad, but I was ready to have it out on Tuesday. Ultimately it can vary 10-15 points from finger sticks. The test is very useful to identify trends and off label the sensor stores 7 days of data so you do get a good sized sample set.

I probably wake up about once a night never really had sweats. A side effect of hypoglycemia can be nightmares which I did have quite often when I was younger.

as someone who has overextended on the purchase of closed QS devices and then attempted to fit them all together into one inference engine, let me tell you that open source QS is definitely the future. It's really a pain in the ass to pool data stream from all the different (closed) sources that don't even care to expose the raw stream. Therefore there's no way in most cases to quantify the errors to bound predictions. With open source, developers can access these information and make much better personal inference engines that can free a person from constantly looking over his data streams.

So I would definitely recommend backing this project or similar open source initiatives in the future.

(fyi, I got a basis purchase invite, but in the end decided not to get it because 1) its heart rate function is essentially useless, 2) its data points are once every minute, which is not fine enough for certain inferences, 3) most importantly it's closed source, and even though there's a hacky way to access the raw in json form right now, there's no guarantee in the future that will be the case.)

I'm rather new to the field of self-quantifying, but I am already fascinated. I've always preferred SMART goals and data-driven decision processes. 

I've started using a diet tracker, a productivity tracker, a mood tracker, and I have a Jawbone UP en route. I'm aggregating my data via Tictrac.com. I'm excited to start quantitatively increasing my productivity, my mood, and my health.

Yet, as I read more content on QS, I have been noticing that almost all attention is being paid to simply quantifying and ""analyzing"" the data. But it seems that very few people are actually DOING anything about the trends and correlations in the data. It seems that there is a missing step here. What is the use of input if it produces no output? Why are tracking gadgets popping up everywhere if they aren't changing peoples' lives?

For me and my fellow newbs, please explain. Tell me how your lives have changed as a result of your data tracking. Give me your tips on getting the most out of my own data tracking.
So it's been 2 months- with adding your jawbone to tictrac, has that been insightful for you? Not to dodge your question, I'm a newbie and just interested in your experience thus far.

I'd love to check it out. No problem with your initial qualifications. Thanks!

I am interested as well.

Hey, I'd love to participate, but like jarwil, am not located in the US. However, I'm just over the border in Canada so I don't mind paying for any additional shipping costs provided that it isn't too excessive. 

Just curious, why light rather than sound?
Regardless, this is cool. I'd certainly be interested if I had any trouble asleep.


Hey I just came across this post now so if you still have units available I would love to be a part of this! Would also be interested in your findings if you were eventually going to make them public.

Anyone know of an app that integrates data from multiple quantified self apps/gadgets? I have a Jawbone UP, use Chronos, and a Memoto on the way and would like to see if there's a way to pull all three into one app. Is there anything like that?What's about creating open source tool? Then you would be able to run your own data analysis or make own visualizations. Plus data would be kept be you not a stinky a startup. 

There are a few companies that seem to be doing this.  If you are looking to share your data between your existing apps from a single control-panel check out: groklife.net, fitdatasync.com    If you are looking to have a common app to view all your data check out: tictrac.com, syncmetrics.com, zenobase.com.  If you are looking for a bunch of data sucked up and provided as an API check out:  humanapi.co.

We're working on it at Narrato, only social feeds at the moment, but we will be integrating with Moves & Fitbit soon. It will be a while before we integrate with the UP and Memoto, but we're planning on it.  (www.getnarrato.com)

We finally went live with the prelaunch of ours.  [Fitoop](http://www.fitoop.com).  

We're doing internal alphas now, and we'll have private beta in the next couple of months.

If you guys have any suggestions and thoughts for what we should incorporate and how you'd like to see it, we'd love to hear them. 

Funny you ask that... I've been working on this myself with a couple of friends.  Got tired of using spreadsheets.  We'll put it online soon.  Pm me if you want to help test. 

Singly has basically done this, as well as released their API as [open source](https://github.com/Singly/hallway), but it's for developers to build on and not for users to use.  I still haven't found a good aggregator, although I know of at least a half dozen folks that have been working on one over the past two years...

I'm more interested in someone making the data comparable.  Obviously, the steps from Jawbone UP is different from Fitbit which is different from Moves... but it'd be cool if there were a way to adjust them so they're more comparable across device... so, someone with an UP could compete against someone with a fitbit on some unified leaderboard.

This is completely needed.
I spent 18 hours this weekend at HackMIT to build a python script that aggregates Jawbone data with RescueTime data and allows basic analysis. It's functional, but some elegant solutions would be FANTASTIC.
If anyone is doing open-source work...I might be willing to contribute.

It's desperately needed.  And some standard data models would be good too.   Im tired of putting my data into yet another proprietary data store.



Fluxtream.com is trying to do this, integrating a number of devices and websites that have APIs.

I'm about to implement a proof-of-concept of such a tool as part of my Masters degree project. Will be open source & free software (GPL) and ideal for self-hosting. It's called [grokya](http://grokya.org) 

I agree: self-hosted would be great. If someone is working with open source, pm me, I might be willing to contribute.

Yeah, I saw you guys on TechCrunch. I'm curious, what has your experience been with integrating with these devices? Do they have easy APIs or do you have to hack them? QS Aggregator?

My startup, [A.R.O.](http://www.aro.com), set out to build an app that would help you begin to quantify how you spend your time on a daily basis. Our three goals? We couldn't ask users to check in (a la Foursquare), we couldn't eat more than 4% of your battery (even with location services turned on), and we couldn't suck at learning where you actually went. It took us almost two years to get that all right with a team of more than 20.

We think our first version is pretty fab. We're not stopping there. Expect calendar integration, data export, integration with more 3rd parties, and killer new sharing features in the weeks ahead.

We're also privacy mavens. We won't sell your data. Ever. And we mean that. Want us to delete your data from our servers forever? We'll do that too -- just delete your account from inside the app.


Edit: I accidentally a word.

Does it work in Canada?

I'm in Belgium, and I get ""This item can not be installed in your device's country"".

Why would you enforce this? :(

The app is free. You say you don't harvest our data. So how do you make money off of this? What's your business plan?

I'm on my Saga. Loving it!

I can confirm that this is OP's startup. Source: he pays me money.

Saga kicks some serious ass, imo. We faithfully track your location even if you leave your phone in your pocket all weekend. You might have to correct a few visits after the fact, but at least you don't have to actively check in order to record your history. My typical week is pretty standard, but it's awesome being able to scroll back through my Lifelog and remember the cool stuff I've done.

My personal favorite thing about Saga is the infographics. You can see how much time you spend at different types of venues, home vs. work, etc. You can even see what your commutes look like at different times of day - which was enough for me to figure out that 6:15 is the sweet-spot for my evening commute!

Speaking of which, it is 6:15 so I should probably wrap this up. Download our app, etc.

Regarding battery life: is it cheaper to monitor periods of inactivity using the accelerometer and only use GPS when the phone is actually on the move? You probably already integrate WiFi in detecting location, I suppose.

Yes. We're in U.S. and Canada this week. Will release to most of the English-speaking world in the next few releases. 

We're eventually going to offer premium services (like search and archive) that we'll charge for. 

Thank you. Any plans for releasing source code?

No. Although we do plan to release a free API. 

Ok. Not ideal, but I doubt there'll be comparable FOSS alternatives in the near future anyways.... So, you've got me on board for now.

No a lot, I use low friction systems to collect the data unless it's really important for a project (wearing a realtime HR sensor during a meeting), I do heart rate with a wahoo HR.

For knowledge work, any acitivity in Google docs, evernote, dropbox, screengrabs, email, chatter, slideshare etc.  They are all open to zapier and ifttt and log in the background automatically.

Looks like you are off to a very good start and you've already seen results in improved health which would be the most important metric on the list.  Body fat measurement would be the best indicator of body composition but be careful it's hard to find an accurate body fat measurement instrument and I would say the best thing to do is to try and stick with one even if it's imperfect.  I invested in a Body Metrix scanner and I like it because I hated calipers but it's somewhat pricey.  I suggest studying pictures of body types on the web and seeing how close you can eyeball body weight percentage to images just as a hedge against bad readings.

 I would consider dropping location soon if you can't find that measuring it improves your life in any manner, also it will make room for something that may be more fruitful.  

Lift looks interesting, [I've admired this approach for doing the same thing but haven't tried it](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2011/01/my-habit-calendar-system-levelling-up.html)

I've had the same idea about using sleep cycle for sleep data but I haven't yet hacked around to see how to get at it's data.  If you make progress on this message me.

Any reason you aren't just using something like google doc's spreadsheet and their form tool to record data? That way you could make your own set of metrics for the things you mentioned you want to start recording, like mood/psychological state, or anything else. It's not quite as easy as existing specialized apps but it's not bad either.

The SleepCycle app on iPhone has native support for exporting your data.

Settings -> Database -> Export database

Thanks karmacrash. I've been using a standard set of digital scales and the potentially noisy body fat estimates they give, and they seem to given consistent readings. I'm not too fussed if there's a little bias in there, they don't need to be perfect to be useful.

I tend to agree on location, I'll give it a little longer though and see if I can use it for some useful change.

Is it feasible for your average joe to create?I've thought about doing this, because I don't think the current fitness monitors measure anything of importance to fitness.  If you believe in steady state cardio then okay I guess maybe a pedometer might be interesting, but there is a shift away from steady state cardio to interval training.  Ditto with heart rate monitor, people no longer believe in getting your heart rate to the ""fat burning zone"" as actually meaning anything.

What would be cool is if you get a fitness monitor that would automatically record how much you are lifting.  So imagine an rfid chip on a bumper plate that would identify the plate and how much weight it is.  Additionally if the chip can be tracked for movement, you could have a smart weight system that tracks your numbers for you.

That would be cool, but instead right now, it's all pedometers...

It looks like someone published the hardware and code for an [Arduino heart rate monitor](http://pulsesensor.myshopify.com/pages/open-hardware), so there's one thing. I'm sure a lot of these things could be made with the Arduino or an app on a phone.

Wouldn't a hear rate monitor be useful for interval tracking? Instead of having to rely of distance and speed you could simply set your intervals for a period of exertion at a certain heart rate?

I'm not a fitness geek so I don't know if heartrate is the desired effect of intervals or not.

The idea behind interval training is to push yourself hard for a certain interval and then rest for a certain interval.  As opposed to steady state cardio where you can maintain a steady heart rate over an extended time.  Interval training wants you to push yourself harder at shorter durations and have a heart rate that is going to fluctuate quite a bit.  So no, I don't think it would be advantageous to do heart rate base interval training

I understand what interval training is. Wouldn't a heart rate fluctuate based on the interval, and wouldn't tracking that be useful? DIY Fitness Monitor: Is it possible?
